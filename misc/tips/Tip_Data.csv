You can drag and drop colors from the color palette to assign it to a node.
Are your cook times getting slow? Use the Performance Monitor to see where the bottleneck is. Find it under Window > Performance Monitor.
You can link various panes to each other by right clicking the tack/pin and setting a number. Number pairs will stay in sync.
Press F1 with your text cursor within the name of a VEX or HScript function to bring up the documentation for it.
"In the Network View, when changing a node's shape with the Shapes palette, press CTRL+LMB on a shape to set that as the default shape for that node type."
CTRL+MMB on a node to bring up the info panel. Click on an attribute on it to create a visualizer in the viewport.
"In the Network View, when setting a node's color with the Colors palette, press CTRL+LMB on a color to set that as the default color for that node type."
ALT+Shift+M opens the Cache Manager where you can clear various caches.
ALT+LMB on a wire in the network editor will make a connector dot. Hold ALT while dragging the dot over multiple lines to 'collect' them into the same connector.
"When using the Tab menu to create a node, pressing SHIFT+ENTER will automatically connect the new node to the selected node. If no node is selected, it will connect to the last selected node."
CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Dragging a node will create a reference copy. This means all parameters are referenced from the original node.
"The expression `opinputpath("".."",0)` gets the path of the node attached to the input of the node that this expression is evaluated on. The digit in the expression controls which input to check for."
Use `vtorigin` and `vrorigin` to get the global position of an object in parameters. This is especially useful for cameras.
MMB+LMB Drag on a color parameter allows you to sample from anywhere on your screens.
Copying a node onto your clipboard using CTRL+C will copy the node path as text.
"Press ALT and a number to quickly switch between pane types. For example, ALT+1 is Scene View, Alt+2 is Network View, etc."
Pressing P while having your mouse hover the network editor creates a resizable parameter interface in your network editor.
Shift+RMB clicking on a parameter you just changed toggles between the current and previous value.
"Hold CTRL+ALT+SHIFT while hovering UI elements to display their tooltips.  For certain UI elements, CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+LMB on them will open the hotkey manager for it."
You can press SHIFT+RMB in the viewport to confirm selections.
"ALT+SHIFT+LMB on a node will select all upstream nodes. ALT+CTRL+LMB does the same, but for downstream nodes. ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+LMB selects both."
"SHIFT+/ launches a ""Fast Find Node"" tool."
"You can use underscores to nicely format large numbers. For example, 10000000 can be written as 10_000_000 for clarity."
Object merge paths in SOP solvers use special syntax. Drag the dop object from the DOP spreadsheet into parameters to automatically build a path with ease!
The Box and Sphere SOP inputs are used as bounding box sources to control the size of the generated box or sphere geometry.
You can drag and drop CHOPs into parameters for the easy creation of channel references.
"The Sprite SOP is a really efficient and cheap way to visualize the ""pscale"" attribute of points/particles without copying geometry to them."
CTRL+ALT+S will enable Toggle Stowbars to clean up the UI. This can also be found under the Edit tab. Enacting this again will return the screenspace to normal.
Press L while your mouse hovers the network editor to automatically organize your network.
Press SHIFT+S in the Network View to change the drawing style of the network wires.
"When using the Tab menu to search for a node, you can type any sequence of letters to search for the node's name. For example, in a Geometry network, ""pb"" returns PolyBevel, ""acr"" returns Attribute Create, etc."
"To find the center point of a polygon (or polygons), use the Convert node with ""Convert To"" set to ""Circle"", followed by an Add node with ""Delete Geometry But Keep the Points"" enabled."
Use an Attribute Delete to delete any unused attributes before caching data to disk to save disk space and speed up processing.
You can use the 'vexprofile' hscript command to profile VEX code.
"SHIFT+LMB on the ""+"" / ""-"" icons in the Edit Parameter Interface to expand/collapse all folders and subfolders."
Press SHIFT+R on multi-input nodes such as Merge and Switch to rearrange the input order.
"When creating output wires from several nodes at the same time, press ALT in the network editor to merge them."
Using $F in parameters is a quick way to try different values using the timeline. Especially in a Switch node.
"You can scale the distance used in PolyBevel using an attribute by setting the scaling mode next to the Distance slider to ""Scale By Attribute""."
"Drag any OBJ node into the viewport to ""drive"" / ""look through"" it. While doing so, pressing \ will toggle between the current and previous view."
"SideFX Houdini has a very active community. Make use of the SideFX Forum, Reddit, ODForce, Real-Time VFX and Discord."
"An easy way to find a good focus distance for cameras is to attach a grid to the camera, and link its Y axis to the focus distance."
"Open a geometry spreadsheet for a node by right-clicking it, and pressing the ""Spreadsheet..."" menu option."
"You can freeze a node by pressing the snowflake icon on the Node Ring that shows up while hovering a node. This will prevent upstream nodes from recooking. Useful for embedding geometry, but will bloat file zise."
"Attribute Randomize can create weighted randomized attribute values by setting the distribution mode to ""Custom Discrete""."
Save space on disk by compressing your volumes with the Volume Compress node! You can almost always get away with writing 16-bit volumes. (Use the Primitive node to set VDBs to write as 16-bit).
