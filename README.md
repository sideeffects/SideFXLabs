# SideFX Labs - Houdini 19.5

SideFX Labs is a completely free, open-source toolset geared towards assisting Houdini users with a variety of tasks commonly used for digital content creation. It is an all-inclusive toolset that spans the shelf, digital assets, custom desktops and scripts and more. The toolset is currently maintained by Mai Ao, Danicka Oglesby, Alan Gordie, and Christos Stavridis. It also receives a lot of contributions from the always active Houdini community. The toolset originated from the GameDevelopmentToolset, which was rebranded in the Houdini 18.0 release. To get automatic bi-weekly updates, subscribe to the our [update log](https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/70854/).

# Roadmap
Please visit our [Public Roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/sidefx/1-sidefx-labs-public-roadmap/) to see what we are working on. You can also vote on features or submit feature ideas.

# Installation

The following instructions are based on the **Windows OS**. Please adapt them accordingly to your OS.

## Method 1 (Personal): Houdini Launcher

Open **Houdini Launcher** and navigate to the **Labs/Packages** section to install a version of SideFX Labs.

The SideFX Labs package will be installed to `C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\sidefx_packages`.

Please note that if you have (perhaps accidentally) installed multiple copies of the same version of SideFX Labs (e.g. SideFXLabs19.5), the copy located in `sidefx_packages` will typically take precedence.

## Method 2 (Deployment): Command Line

You can also install the SideFX Labs package through command line, for example, using **Command Prompt** or **Houdini Command Line Tools** (C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini 19.5.100\bin\hcmd.exe). This is especially useful for deployment in a studio environment.

To install the latest production build, the latest daily build, or to uninstall (listed in this order), the commands are:
```
"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" install-package --package-name "SideFX Labs 19.5 Production Build" --installdir "D:\studio\sidefxlabs"

"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" install-package --package-name "SideFX Labs 19.5 Daily Build" --installdir "D:\studio\sidefxlabs"

"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" uninstall-package "D:\studio\sidefxlabs\SideFXLabs19.5.json"
```
("D:\studio\sidefxlabs" is just an example path.)

To replace part of a hard-coded path with an environment variable, you need to first define the environment variable on the machine that executes the commands.

Press the Windows key to search for **Edit environment variables for your account**, and then click **New...** on the **Environment Variables** window to add a new variable.

Please note that Houdini-specific environment variables, such as `HSITE`, `HOME`, etc., are not automatically recognized in **Command Prompt** or **Houdini Command Line Tools** when you type in commands. For command line installation purposes, adding environment variables to `houdini.env` or a Houdini package definition JSON file is not enough. You have to define them in the system.

Once the environment variable is set (e.g. MY_SIDEFXLABS = D:\studio\sidefxlabs), then the commands become:

```
"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" install-package --package-name "SideFX Labs 19.5 Production Build" --installdir "%MY_SIDEFXLABS%"

"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" install-package --package-name "SideFX Labs 19.5 Daily Build" --installdir "%MY_SIDEFXLABS%"

"C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Launcher\bin\houdini_installer.exe" uninstall-package "%MY_SIDEFXLABS%\SideFXLabs19.5.json"
```

## Method 3 (Specific Versions / Steam Houdini Users): GitHub

Sometimes you may need to access an earlier release or to get the same-day updates before the next day's release is downloadable. In those cases, you can get the package directly from this GitHub repository.

Step 1. [Option A] Download one of the releases from [here](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs/releases). Choose a release version/date, expand **Assets** and select either one of the **Source code** zip files. This step can be automated with a script that downloads the zip files from either one of the following URLs (replace 19.5.100 with the desired version number).

```
https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs/archive/refs/tags/19.5.100.zip
https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs/archive/refs/tags/19.5.100.tar.gz
```

Step 1. [Option B] Click on the top-right **Code** button on the main page of this repository and select **Download ZIP**. This allows you to get the same-day updates before the next day's release is downloadable.

Step 1. [Option C] (Advanced) Clone this repository into a custom SideFXLabs directory of your choosing. Skip Step 2.

Step 2. If you have downloaded a zipped version of the package in Step 1, unzip it into a custom SideFXLabs directory of your choosing.

Step 3. Go to your custom SideFXLabs directory that now contains the unzipped contents, copy the package definition template file `SideFXLabs.json` to `C:\Users\...\Documents\houdini19.5\packages`. Rename the destination copy to `SideFXLabs19.5.json`. Open this file and replace `"$HOUDINI_PACKAGE_PATH/SideFXLabs19.5"` (line 8) with the path to your own SideFXLabs directory. When Houdini launches, it relies on this file to discover the location of your SideFX Labs package.

(Step 3 only needs to be done once for every major Houdini X.Y release. To update SideFX Labs for the same Houdini X.Y version, simply delete the existing contents of your custom SideFXLabs directory and unzip the updated package into that folder.)

## Verification
If SideFX Labs is successfully installed, launch Houdini and you should see a **Labs** menu on the top-left menu bar.

# Additional Information

## Live Development
We're actively developing the tools in this repository. The [releases](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs/releases) provide safe checkpoints in the code for you to download.

## Expanded HDAs
All of the HDAs are using the expanded format that was introduced in H16. This allows better diffing of the tools so you can see what our changes are doing and choose to integrate them back into your production.

## Example Files
Instead of tying the examples as HDAs, we will be generating separate hip files that show how the tools should work in context. These can be found [here](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs/tree/Development/hip).

## Data Analytics
SideFX Labs *optionally* collects data about what tools are used through Google Analytics. We do this in order to focus our resources on the more active tools and therefore be able to help more people. This does *not* track any personal user data such as IP, Name, License use etc. To opt-out of this tracking, you can disable the "Send Anonymous Usage Statistics" toggle under preferences. Additionally, you can bypass this behavior entirely by setting the environment variable "HOUDINI_ANONYMOUS_STATISTICS = 0".

## Other Environment Variables
SideFX Labs has a few other environment variables that can be set to modify the behavior of the toolset and its installation process:
1. "SIDEFXLABS_NOINSTALL_MESSAGE = Your message here" - Disables the installing of the toolset on the machine, and shows the text stored in the environment variable.
2. "SIDEFXLABS_ADMIN_UPDATES = 1" - This prevents users from updating the already installed toolset on their machine. Useful for studios where one version of the toolset is enforced.
