""" This utility tool is a set of four actions via hotkeys that allow you to step or walk around the node network.  """

== Overview ==
Network Walk is a set of four actions via hotkeys that allow you to walk around the node network.

These actions are mapped to the corresponding hotkeys: 
PageUp = Move Up
PageDown = Move Down
Insert = Move Left
Home = Move Right

Coupled with the default U and I keys, these keys can let you traverse networks quickly and intuitively.

Network Walk displays brief feedback messages in Network View to indicate the current location and direction of the traversal.

The Network Walk shelf tool assigns or removes its hotkey keys and actions. Restart Houdini for the changes to take effect.
