""" Compare node parameter values and highlight the differences. """

The Diff tool is a very simple tool that compares nodes together and highlights the parameters with different values.

== Using Diff ==
                    
# Click on the shelf icon to launch the widget.

# Fill in the paths to the nodes you want to compare.
            
# The Diff widget will highlight parameters with different values.

      """ The Diff widget interface comparing two spheres. """

TIP:
    Select the nodes you want to compare before launching the Diff tool, it will automatically pick up the node pathes for you.

NOTE:
    You can change the value of a parameter directly from the interface.
    To do that, double click on the parameter value, enter a new value and hit enter.

== Use Cases ==
- You duplicated some part of your network, and you now have differences in the viewport. You can use the Diff tool to do a one to one node comparison.
- You want to compare nodes laid down by shelf tools.
