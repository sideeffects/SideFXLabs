""" Viewport shader for motion vector textures """

This shader can be used to distort a sprite texture based on it's UV's and a motion vector texture (generated by the Motion Vectors ROP)

@parameters
    Diffuse Texture:
        The texture to distort. Usually this would be a smoke or explosion texture sheet.
    Motion Vector Texture:
        A normalized, texture space motion vector texture
    Time:
        Current time in the playbar. Decides which frame in a texture sheet will be displayed.
    Speed:
        A multiplier to slow down or speed up the general playback of the texture sequence.
    Apply Double Motion Vector:
        This creates a smoother transition when blending the texture values. Turning this off is faster to compute but probably unnecessary in the viewport.
    Rows:
        No. of images in the y direction of the texture sheet.
    Columns:
        No. of images in the x direction of the texture sheet.
    Distortion:
        A multiplier of the distortion effect created by the motion vector texture. Generally this should be 1 / $FPS.
