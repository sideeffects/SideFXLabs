"""A simple flamefront combustion model. """

This microsolver can be used to augment a pyro network with a flamefront
based combustion model.  Instead of relying on temperature diffusion to
ignite fuel, this will use an explicit flamefront.  This allows the speed
of the flamefront to be tuned with greater control.

Several additional solver fields are created and used by this microsolver.

`fuel`:
    The amount of fuel in a voxel.  This should be a mass-fraction, so
    be a 0..1 range.  1 implies the voxel has 100% fuel and no other
    constituent.  Usually this is sourced by the pyrosolver using maximum.

`waste`:
    The result of burning fuel and ambient air; this is the waste products.
    Tracking this allows for oxygen limited burning.  Like fuel, this should
    be a 0..1 range.

`flamefront`:
    A signed distance field specifying the flame front.  Anything inside
    this field is considered burning so will combust if sufficient air
    and fuel is present.

`burn`:
    This is an output field that records how much combustion occurred
    in a voxel.

`ignite`:
    An input field used to trigger combustion wherever it is greater
    than 0.5 and fuel exists.  This is reset after applying, so can
    be sourced in the pyrosolver using maximum.

It is important to setup the pyrosolver to process these extra fields.
Rather than performing advection internally to this solver, it is expected
the fields are added to the extra advection fields of the pyrosolver.

The PyroSolver's Advanced::Resizing::Extra Fields should have `fuel waste flamefront` added to it.  The Advanced::Resizing::Reference Fields should have `fuel` added to it.  The Advanced::Advection::Extra Fields should have `fuel waste flamefront` added.

@parameters
    == Properties ==

    Voxel Size:
	Should be linked to the division size of the pyrosolver.  Used to
	slowly combust fuel as it crosses the flamefront boundary in
	a sub-voxel step.

    == Flame Front ==

    Ignition Temperature:
	If a voxel's temperature exceeds this point it will add itself to
	the flame front and ignite.  Note too low of an ignition temperature
	will cause the fire to spread primarily from heat diffusion,
	making the flame speed irrelevant.

    Flame Speed:
	How far the flame front moves in one second.  If units are meters,
	a value of 0.35 will correspond to natural gas. 0.55 would be
	methane, and 7.7 hydrogen.

    Min Speed Ratio:
	The speed of flame is dependent on how far off the stoichiometric
	conditions the fuel/air ratio is.  The fuel is treated as an
	ideal substance with a 1:1 ideal ratio, with full speed
	at that ratio and falling to this percentage of that speed at the
	extremes.  A min speed ratio of 0.2 means the flame will travel
	at 20% of its ideal speed when in the least advantageous conditions.
	
    Bandwidth:
	The flamefront has to be re-initialized to ensure the signed distance
	field can be updated in a single step.  Sufficient bandwidth is needed
	or the entire object will burst into flame in a single step.

	`(flamespeed / (FPS * substeps)) < bandwidth * voxelsize`
    
    == Burning ==

    Expansion on Combust:
	When fuel burns it directly adds to the divergence field by this
	amount.  This covers instantaneous heating and molar changes due
	to chemical reactions.

    Temp Gain on Combust:
	The amount to add to the temperate field when a unit of fuel burns.
	Since it is oxygen limited, this often is greater than one as
	an entire unit of fuel can't burn as it lacks air.

    Diffusion Rate:
	Without fresh oxygen the fuel will burn out and be replaced
	by waste products, quenching any further reaction.  Diffusion
	allows the fuel and waste to transport and mix into air, creating
	a diffusion flame.

    == Visualize ==

    Simple visualization options are included for the main fields.  They
    can also be exported from the pyrosolver and processed farther.
