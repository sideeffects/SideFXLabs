= Labs Gas Expand from Temperature  =

"""Creates divergence from temperature change. """

This microsolver can be used to augment a pyro network to expand
or compress the fluid according to temperature change.  This is done
by storing the old temperature in an `oldtemperature` field that
should be advected with the simulation.

It is important to setup the pyrosolver to process the oldtemperature field.
Rather than performing advection internally to this solver, it is expected
the field is added to the extra advection fields of the pyrosolver.

The Advanced::Advection::Extra Fields should have `oldtemperature` added.

@parameters
    Expansion from Temp:
	Changes in temperature will trigger expansion and compression of
	the field.  This scales how much to apply that expansion.

    == Properties ==

    Ambient Temp (K):
	Used by divergence-from-temperature change to map the zero temperature.

    Reference Temp (K):
	Used by divergence-from-temperature change to map the one temperature.

    == Visualize ==

    Simple visualization options are included for the oldtemperature field.
    This is most useful to ensure it is properly advected.

    == Bindings ==

    These override which DOP fields will be used for each of the semantic
    operations.

    Temperature:
	Stores the current temperature and is used to detect the
	change in temperature.

    Old Temperature:
	Stores the previous temperature.  Will be re-initialized to the
	temperature value during this operation.

    Divergence:
	The field to add the desired volume-change to.
