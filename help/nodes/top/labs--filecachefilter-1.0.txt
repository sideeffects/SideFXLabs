= Labs File Cache Filter =

"""Partition work items used for file caching"""

== Overview ==

This node is mostly used as a basic building block for [TOP Labs File Cache node|Node:top/labs::topfilecache::1.0], and used to filter work items on different cache types.

== Cache Types ==
This node differentiates between two distinctive cache types based on `frame` and `range` top attributes:

* __Time Independent / Static Geometry / Model__
    :task: To create a Time Independent work item:
        # Create a [Range Generate node|Node:top/rangegenerate].
        # Set all three components of the __Value Range__ parameter to 1. This will set both the `frame` and the `range` attribute on the work item to 1.
        
* __Time Dependent / Geometry Sequence__
    :task: To create a Time Dependent work item:
        # Create a [Range Generate node|Node:top/rangegenerate].
        # Make sure the first and second values of __Value Range__ parameter are not the same. This will give you multiple work items with the same `range`, but each with different `frame` number. 

Additionally, each of these cache types can be wedged, in which case top wedge attributes such as `wedgeindex`, `wedgenum`, `wedgetotal`, `wedgecount` must exist on the work items.

@parameters

    == Filtering ==

    Filter Mode:      
        #id: filtermode
        Sets how to filter work items for the output. 
        
        Split Items:
            Splits the work items between the left and the right output, based on if they are filtered or not.
            
        Create Attribute:
            Do not split the work items, but instead only an attribute, called `filter`, that can be used later to process work items. Use only the first output of the node in this case.
            
    Filter Non Selected:
        #id: filteroperation
        Reverses the selection of the filtered work items. 
        
    Filter Subframes:
        #id: filtersubframes
        Removes any subframes, frames that are not landing on integer values, from the Time Dependent work items.
        
    === Time Independent ===

    Filter Time Independet:
        #id: filtertimeindependent
        Filter work items that are `static`. Time Independent work items have their `frame` and `range` attribute values are all set to `1`.
        
    === Time Dependent ===

    Filter Time Dependent:
        #id: filtertimedependent
        Filter work items that are in a sequence. Time Dependent work items have a `range` attribute that is not set to `1` for all components, and for each work item in the sequence has a different `frame` number.
        
    Filter by:
        #id: trange
        Selects the frames in the sequence to filter.

        All Frames:
            All the frames are selected.

        Single Frame:
            The current frame is selected.

        Frame Range:
            Frames in the given range will be selected. When working with substeps, make sure the 3rd component of the __Frame Range__ parameter is set to the right substep, otherwise some work items might not be selected.

        Specific Frames:
            Sets the wedge values by a list of independent range sequences or numbers. The listings can be separated by whitespace, commas and semi-colons. Use the syntax `min-max:stepsize`, which expands to values between `min` and `max`, separated by `stepsize`. When `stepsize` is not provided, the default value of  `1` is used. 

    Override Frame:
        #id: frameoverride
        When __Filter by__ is set to __Single Frame__ and the checkbox to the left is on, cache this explicit frame number instead of the current frame from the timeline.

    Frame Range:
        #id: f
        Sets the minimum and maximum values with the range, along with the stepsize. 
        
    List of Frames:
        #id: specificrange
        Sets the frame values by a list of independent range sequences or numbers. The listings can be separated by whitespace, commas and semi-colons. Use the syntax `min-max:stepsize`, which expands to values between `min` and `max`, separated by `stepsize`. When `stepsize` is not provided, the default value of  `1` is used.

    === Wedges ===

    Filter by Wedge:
        #id: filterwedge
        Filter work items that has wedge attributes present (`wedgeindex`, `wedgenum`, `wedgetotal`, `wedgecount`).
        
    Filter by:
        #id: wrange
        Selects the wedges to filter.
        
        All Wedges:
            Select all existing wedges.
            
        Single Wedge:
            Select a single wedge (given by __Single Wedge__).
            
        Custom Range:
            Wedges in the given range will be selected. 
            
        Specific Wedges:
            Sets the wedge values by a list of independent range sequences or numbers. Use the syntax `min-max:stepsize`, which expands to values between `min` and `max`, separated by `stepsize`. When `stepsize` is not provided, the default value of  `1` is used. In case of wedging, the wedge numbers are always integer values, so `stepsize` should not be used.

    Single Wedge:
        #id: wedgeoverride
        Sets the wedge number to select

    Wedge Range:
        #id: wedgerange
        Sets the minimum and maximum range of the selected wedge values.
        
    List of Wedges:
        #id: specificwedges
        Sets the wedge values by a list of independent range sequences or numbers. The listings can be separated by whitespace, commas and semi-colons. Use the syntax `min-max:stepsize`, which expands to values between `min` and `max`, separated by `stepsize`. When `stepsize` is not provided, the default value of  `1` is used. In case of wedging, the wedge numbers are always integer values, so `stepsize` should not be used.
