""" Diffs a variety of geometry, text and image files. """

This node will diff data and tell you if they are identical, and if not, what the differences are between the pairs. This is extremely useful in for example regression tests to check if your tool produces different outputs than before.
The tool does this based on pairs that have to be defined on a per work-item basis. Each work-item is expected to have two attributes, each pointing to a file on disk. 

Supported types of data:

# text_types = .txt, .html, .csv
# geo_types = .geo, .bgeo", .bgeo.gz, .bgeo.sc, .fbx (gets converted to bgeo during diff)
# image_types = .exr, .png", .jpg


Example: (Please see the demo scene found on this tool on GitHub in the Labs hip repository)

- Expected File Attribute: baseline_file = C:/file1.png 

- Actual File Attribute: test_file = C:/file2.png

@parameters
    Expected File Attribute:
        A string attribute name on the work-item pointing to the file containing "correct" data.
    Actual File Attribute:
        A string attribute name on the work-item pointing to the file containing "to be tested" data.
