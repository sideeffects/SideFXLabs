""" Create a tube from a curve, with UVs and normals. """

The cylinder generator wraps up some common functionality for generating tubes for realtime vfx. You can quickly set the inner and outer radius, modify the profile and add noise to shape the tube for multiple use cases. UV's are automatically laid out and adjusted with override controls. Add vertex colour based on u or v to drive material parameters in your game engine.

@parameters
	== Settings ==
	=== Default Cylinder ===
	NOTE:
		A default cylinder is created when no curve input is connected.
	Length:
		Size of default cylinder.
	Origin:
		Starting position of default cylinder.
	Direction:
		Initial direction of default cylinder.			
	=== Creation ===
	Inner Radius:
		Distance from the center of the object for the starting circle.
	Outer Radius:
		Distance from the center of the object for the end circle.
	Arc Start:
		Start point of the arc in degrees, relative to the x-axis.
	Arc End:
		End point of the arc in degrees, relative to the x-axis.
	Add Twist:
		Offset each segment based on the twist value
	Twist:
		Rotation value for each segment, measured in rotations.
	U Segments:
		Number of polygon segments around the tube.
	V Segments:
		Number of polygon segments along the tube.
	Normal Cusp Angle:
		When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.
	Cap Ends:
		Create end caps on the tube.
	Cap Type:
		Choose whether to make end caps a single polygon or a triangulated fan.
	Soften Cap Normals:
		Blends the normals between the end caps and the cylinder.
	Smoothing Distance:
		The distance along the cylinder from the end cap to smooth.
	Smoothing Strength:
		Amount of smoothing applied to end cap normals.
	=== Advanced ===
	Curvature Resample:
		Resamples cylinder based on curvature, giving more fidelity to curves and reducing geometry on straight areas.
	Min Segment Length:
		Minimum distance between cylinder segments.
	Segment Distance:
		Threshold distance to remove colinear segments. Works in tandem with __Min Segment Length__.
	=== Ramp ===
	Ramp Multiplier:
		Increase or decrease the effect of the profile ramp.
	Curve Ramp:
		Use the ramp to modify the shape of the tube.
    == UVs ==
	Rotate UVs 90:
		This essentially flips the u and v direction of the UVs.
	U Tiling:
		Repeat the UVs in the u direction for tiling effects.
	V Tiling:
		Repeat the UVs in the v direction for tiling effects.
	U Range And Bias:
		The first two components set the coverage of the UVs in the u direction. The third component distorts the UVs using a power function.
	V Range And Bias:
		The first two components set the coverage of the UVs in the v direction. The third component distorts the UVs using a power function.
	
    == Noise ==
    Add Noise:
        Enable Perlin noise distortion of the geometry.
    Noise Intensity:
        Displacement amount.
    Noise Scale:
        Scale the noise independently in each axis.
    Noise Octaves:
        The number of composited noise layers.
    Add UV Noise:
        Distort the UVs with noise.
    UV Frequency:
        Frequency of the noise in texture space.
    UV Offset:
        Offset the noise position.
    UV Noise Intensity:
        Displace amount of UVs.
		
	
		
    == Vertex Color ==
    Add Color:
        Create a vertex attribute, Cd.
    V Color Ramp:
        Switch the ramp from using the u direction to the v direction of the UVs.
