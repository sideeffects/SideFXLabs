= Labs Connectivity and Segmentation =

"""This node segments geometry based on connectivity, UV islands, proximity clustering, and custom attributes. This is very useful when paired with the multithreaded functionality of compile blocks."""

:tip: 
	Compilable Segments is a helpful group of nodes that automatically connects a Connectivity and Segmentation node to a compile block and for each loop formatted to run over segmented geometry.

@parameters

    == Segmentation Mode ==
        
    Connectivity:
        #id: connectmenu
	Options to segment geometry based on connectivity and UV islands.
	
        3D:
		Segments geometry based on individual connectivity.
            
        3D and UV:
		Segments and geometry based on separate UV islands. Remeshing by connectivity is included in this option.
            

    Input Attribute:
        #id: attrname
        Segments geometry based on a custom primitive integer attribute.
		
        

    Target Bucket Size:
        #id: targetbucket
        Segments geometry by clustering primitives. This value is the target number of polygons in each cluster. A lower value generates more clusters.
		
    Bucket Seed:
        #id: clusterseed
        Randomize geometry clusters.
		
    Visualize Segments:
        #id: visualizesegments
        Assigns a random color to each segment.
    === Refine Bucket Boundary ===
	Segmenting geometry by grouping primitives into buckets can create irregularly-shaped segments. Refining the boundary compacts these segments into more regular shapes while respecting connectivity and UV boundaries.
    Search Depth:
        #id: depth
        Immediate Neighbours:
            Restricts segment consolidation to near primitive neighbors.
        Extended Neighbours:
            Searches primitive neighbors within an influence range to determine segment consolidation.
    Extended Influence:
        #id: extweight
        The range of influence to search for neighbors.
    Iterations:
        #id: iterations
        The number of iterations to perform boundary refinement. More iterations increases consolidation.

    == Output ==

    Segment Attribute:
        #id: segmentattrib
        The name of the primitive attribute containing the segment number the primitive belongs to.

        
    Boundary Edges:
        #id: edgegroup
        Output the boundaries between the segments as an edge group.
