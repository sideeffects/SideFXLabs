= Labs Volume Adjust Look =

"""Adjusts volume visualization mode (default / normals / motion vectors), density, colors (including greyscale colors), emission, and viewport rendering quality."""

This node can convert volumes to greyscale, normal visualization mode, or motion vector visualization mode. It can also adjust volume density, diffuse color, emission color, shadow, and viewport rendering quality (which has an effect on certain banding artifacts).

TIP:
    Compared to _Volume Visualization SOP_ and _Pyro Bake Volume SOP_, this node offers similar but simpler controls. What those two nodes do not offer are greyscale conversion, normal / motion vector visualization modes, per-component color scaling, and viewport rendering quality adjustments.

NOTE:
    This node replaces _Labs_Volume Detail Attributes SOP_, which will be removed in Houdini 20.


@parameters

    Mode:
        #id: mode
        The overall visualization mode.  
        <p>*Adjust Colors*: Default visualization mode.</p>
        <p>*Visualize Normals*: Normal visualization mode, affected by density. Sets the detail attribute `volvis_normals` to 1.</p>            
        <p>*Visualize Motion Vectors*: Motion vector visualization mode, affected by density and emission. Sets the detail attribute `volvis_motionvec` to 1.</p>

    Convert to Greyscale:
        #id: greyscalemode
        How to convert the diffuse and emissive colors to greyscale. The [relative luminance|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance] coefficients reflects the spectral weighting for human vision. The Rec.709 standard is newer than the the Rec.601 standard, but both are still widely used. Their differences are rather complicated. You can default to Rec.709 unless you know what standard you should use.
        <p>*Do Not Convert*: Does not perform conversion.</p>   
        <p>*Using Rec.709 Relative Luminance Coefficients*: Performs conversion using the Rec.709 relative luminance coefficients (Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B).</p>
        <p>*Using Rec.601 Relative Luminance Coefficients*: Performs conversion using the Rec.601 relative luminance coefficients (Y = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B).</p>
        <p>*Using Custom RGB Weighted Sum*: Performs conversion using custom RGB weights. The weights will be used as they are and will not be normalized. The default weights are the same as the Rec.709 coefficients.</p>
            
    R Weight:
        #id: relluminancer
        How much the red value contributes to the greyscale value. 

    G Weight:
        #id: relluminanceg
        How much the green value contributes to the greyscale value.
        
    B Weight:
        #id: relluminanceb
        How much the blue value contributes to the greyscale value.
        
    Density Multiplier:
        #id: densitymul
        Adjusts the smoke density. The `density` volume is multiplied by this value.

    Shadow Multiplier:
        #id: shadowmul
        Adjusts the shadow intensity. The detail attribute `volvis_shadowscale` is multiplied by this value.
        
    Diffuse Color Multiplier:
        #id: diffusemul
        Adjusts the smoke color. The primitive attribute `Cd`, the `Cd` volume, and the detail attribute `volvis_cdramp` are multiplied by this value.
    
    Diffuse Scale Multiplier:
        #id: diffusescalemul
        Adjusts the overall smoke color intensity. *Diffuse Color Multiplier* is internally multiplied again by this value.

    Emit Color Multiplier:
        #id: emitmul
        Adjusts the emission color. The `scatter` volume, the `Ce` volume, and the detail attribute `volvis_emitcdramp` are multiplied by this value.
        
    Emit Scale Multiplier:
        #id: emitscalemul
        Adjusts the overall emission intensity. The detail attribute `volvis_emitscale` is multiplied by this value.
        
    Adjust Emission Intensity Volume Binding:
        #id: adjustemitfield
        Adjusts the volume used to scale emission intensity.
        
    Intensity Volume:
        #id: emitfield
        The volume used to scale emission intensity. This sets the detail attribute `volvis_emitfield`.
        
    Source Range:
        #id: emitrange
        The min and max values of the intensity volume. When the intensity volume is used to scale the emission intensity, it is clamped to this range first.
        <p>The default values are the min and max values of the input intensity volume, so if *Intensity Volume* is different from the input detail attribute `volvis_emitfield`, consider adjusting this range accordingly as the new intensity volume may have a different source range.</p>
        
    Adjust Viewport Volume Quality:
        #id: adjustquality
        Adjusts the viewport volume quality (specifically, the ambient occlusion quality). You can improve the AO quality to reduce certain horizontal banding artifacts.
        
    AO Texture Size:
        #id: mapsize
        The size of the texture for rendering the volume in viewport. Higher values mean better quality, slower rendering, and higher memory consumption.
        
    AO Sampling Step Size:
        #id: steprate
        The step size for sampling the volume in viewport. Lower values mean better quality and slower rendering.
