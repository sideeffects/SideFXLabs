""" Generates leaves on branches """

The Tree Leaf Generator generates leaves on branches created with the Tree Branch Generator or Tree Branch Placer.

@parameters
    == Global ==
    Tag:
        Creates an attribute and group for the leaf geometry/curve under this name (node name by default)
    Branch on Group:
        Generate leaves on a specific curve group. If blank, branches are generated on curves of the previous branch level
    Delete Previous Levels:
        Delete geometry and curves from all previous branch levels
    Randomize:
        Random seed value
    Pack and Instance:
        Pack and instance leaves (does not allow editing of tropism or noise but is faster)
    Treat as Atlas:
        Enable this if using the Quixel Atlas Splitter (or a similar method) to create multiple leaf cards from an atlas.
        This will generate new cards with the same UVs and dimensions and randomly scatter each variation
    Use Variant:
        Use if inputting multiple leaf types to be scattered separately. Each variation must have a variation integer attribute starting at 0
    == General ==

    Custom Up:
        Available if using custom up vector. Orient leaves by this vector
    Branching Pattern:

        * 137.5 degrees
        * 90 degrees
        * 180 degrees
        Type of branching from leaf points
        * Alternate - one leaf per branch point

    Light Source:
        Input an object or light to use as a light source
    Light Direction:

        * Constrain - snap leaves along grid
        * Clip - delete leaves beneath grid
        * None - do nothing when leaves intersect with grid
    Normal Method:
        Method to calculate normals on leaf geometry
