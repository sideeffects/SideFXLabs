"""Multiple Min/Max/Average analysis in a single node."""

[Image:/images/sidefxlabs_banner.jpg]

This analyzes and gets the average, min, max, and different other values of an attribute using the same node.

@parameters

    Attribute:
        #id: attribute
        Attribute to analyze.
    Attribute Class:
        #id: attribute_type
        This is the class which the attribute starts in. It can be one of point, primitive, or vertex.
            
    Attribute Rename:
        #id: attribute_rename
	The new name for the attribute. There is a choice to add a prefix or a suffix.
            
    == Number of Analysis ==

    Analysis Mode:
        #id: method#
	The mode being used for the analysis to return a value.
        
        Maximum:
            Picks the largest match.
        Minimum:
            Picks the smallest match.
        Average:
            The mean, or the sum of all matches divided by the number of matches.
        Mode:
            The most common match. If there is more than one most common, it will be the minimum of the most common.
        Median:
            The middle of the matches. If there is an even number of elements, it is the higher of the two possible middles.
        Sum:
            All of the matches added together.
        Sum of Squares:
            All of the matches squared, and then added together.
        Root Mean Square:
            The square root of the average of the squares of all the matches.
        First Match:
            The first valid match. For promoting points to primitives, this would be the point of the first vertex in the primitive.
        Last Match:
            The last valid match. For promoting points to primitives, this would be the point of the last vertex in the primitive.

    Prefix:
        #id: prefix#
        The string that is added as a prefix to the new name of the attribute.
    Suffix:
        #id: suffix#
        The string that is added as a suffix to the new name of the attribute.
    Promote to Detail Attribute:
        #id: detail_attribute#
	When this is enabled the attribute gets promoted to the Detail class.
