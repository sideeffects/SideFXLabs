""" Divide polygons into panels """

:video:
    #src:/movies/lotsubdivision.mp4

This node divides polygons into panels. Spaceships, sci-fi interiors, city blocks, irregular walls, all require flat sections of geometry to be subdivided into panels of varying sizes. This node iteratively subdivides polygons into smaller 'lots', with control over minimum size, number of iterations, irregularity.

It also has the ability to cluster lots together to form even more interesting shapes.
    
@parameters
    == Base Settings ==
    Alignment:
        Method of orientating the cuts. Bounding box is for world space cutting, longest edge is relative to the shape. 
    Minimum Lot Size:
        Primitives smaller than this size will no longer be considered for cutting
    Iterations:
        Number of Subdivisions of cutting. 1 will give you 2 primitives, 2 will give you 4, etc. etc. 
    Random Seed:
        Randomization control
    == Shape Settings ==
    Irregularity:
        Smaller values mean the cuts will be halfway along a primitive, higher values will yield primitives of different sizes. 
    Vertical Bias:
        Negative numbers will generate horizontal slivers, Positive numbers will generate vertical slivers
    Vertical Packing:
        Strength on a Gradient that clumps lots together towards the top (or bottom)
    Cluster Lots:
        Enables joining of lots into clusters
    Number of Clusters:
        Final Number of Lots after merging them into clusters
    Random Seed:
        Randomization control on the cluster grouping
