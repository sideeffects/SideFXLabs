"""A simple utility that creates arrow indicators on poly primitives displaying their vertex order."""

This node is useful to visualize the vertex order of primitives.
Especially useful when vertex order is important, such as for road splines to indicate the road direction.


@parameters

    == Group == 

        *Filter a primitive group selection to specify what primitives should receive an arrow indicator.*
        
    Group Name: 
        #id: groupname
        Specify a primitive group selection to filter where to create vertex order indicators.
        

    == Visual Feedback == 

        *Configure how to arrows are rendered*
        
    Arrow Scale:
        #id: guideScale
        Set the scale of wireframe arrow indicators.

    Arrow Color Type:
        #id: outclass
        Specify what type of color attribute to output to (and get from when sampling the color from the source).      
        
    Arrow Color Method:
        #id: arrowColorMethod
        Set the mode for the arrow color indicators.  

    Arrow Color:
        #id: color
        Set a global color for the arrow indicators.
        
    == Output ==

    Group Arrows:
        #id: groupArrows
        When enabled, allows you to set the group name for the arrow indicators.
        
    Prim Number Attrib:
        #id: primNumber
        When enabled, copies the primimtive number to a new attribute and set it on the source primitives and their respective arrow geometry.
        
    Include Source Geometry in Output:    
        #id: includeSourceGeometry
        When enabled, includes the input geometry with the output.
