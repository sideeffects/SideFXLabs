"""  Retrieves the depth value of each pixel from the cameras using Alicevision. """

The objective of this step is to retrieve the depth value for each pixel in the images and cameras that had previously been resolved by Structure From Motion. This can take a very long time depending on the resolution and number of images provided.

    == Main ==
    Cook:
        Start the cooking process for this step.
    Manual Mode:
        This toggle controls if the node should automatically recook if any dependencies have changed.
    Use Log:
        This toggle controls if the status of the current node should be printed to the console. This is useful for getting a quick overview of the progress.
