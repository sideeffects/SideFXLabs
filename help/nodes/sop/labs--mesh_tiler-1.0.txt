"""Makes packed geometry lying on a plane tileable."""

This node takes any packed geometry placed within an (optionally) provided reference plane and makes the edges tile. It does so by detecting any meshes that overlap the boundary and copying them to the other side to produce tiling. This is a useful workflow to, for example, generate a large variety of tiling textures by simulating objects falling to the ground and making them tile before baking.

@parameters
    == Tiling ==
    Mode:
        This controls the type of output that will be produced from the tool. `Full Tile` will make the output fully tileable (Used for baking), and `Piece Tile` will produce an output similar to a puzzle piece (Used for instancing the tiled result).
    X-Axis:
        Controls at which side the X axis should be tiling.
    Z-Axis:
        Controls at which side the Z axis should be tiling.
    Export Ground Plane:
        Enabling this toggle will also export the planar surface used to tile around.
    Overlap Density:
        This slider controls what percentage of the geometry that got tiled should be kept. Lowering this number can reduce the appearance of a thicker border on the tile.
    == Debug ==
    Visualize Tiling:
        Enabling this will generate a heightfield from the output. This is useful for previewing what the result of a baked heightmap would look like. Easy to spot issues.
    Visualize Overlapping Elements:
        This will color the border geometry on the generated heightfield red.
    Debug Resolution:
        Controls the resolution of the generated debug Heightfield.
    == Advanced ==
    Piece Attribute:
        Sets the name of the attribute that will contain the unique id of each tiled element. If a piece gets tiled on for example one axis, two pieces will share a unique id.
    Overlap Group Name:
        Sets the name of the group containing the newly tiled geometry that got generated inside the tool.
