""" Take a volume as an input and export a texture of the density field. """

The Volume Texture Export is useful for converting volumes into textures that can be used in a realtime engine. Instead of creating a custom 3D texture, this outputs a 2D texture that can be read by all engines and then processed to be used as volumetric data at realtime.

Use the dropdown presets to match UE4's expected volume texture inputs.

Internally the volume is converted to the target output resolution. That means one voxel equals one pixel and the resulting volume is a cube.

@parameters
    Render:
        Generate the texture.
    Valid Frame Range:
        Use the dropdown to render a single frame or a sequence.
    Start/End/Inc:
        Start and End Frame as well as how many increments in between.
    == Sampling ==
    Up Axis:
        By default, the texture is exported with Z up to match UE4.
    == Slicing ==
    Slices (res^3):
        This is the resolution in voxels of the converted volume. Remember one voxel generally equals one pixel. It's recommended to use the resolution dropdown to set this parameter.
    Images Per Line:
        It's recommended to use the resolution dropdown to set this parameter.
    Expected Resolution:
        Based on the slices and images per line this is the ideal resolution of the texture.
    Resolution:
        The final output of the texture. It's recommended that this match the expected resolution.
    == Output ==
    Preview:
        Generate a preview of the texture in the viewport.
    Invert Values:
        When working with SDF's this can be useful to return the complement of the volume sample.
    Output Picture:
        Path of exported image.
