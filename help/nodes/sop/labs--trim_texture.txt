""" Interactive version of the Trim Texture node. """

This node is the interactive version of the automatic trim texture tool.
The tool takes in two inputs. The left (primary) input takes in the geometry you would like to Trim. It does not need UVs.
The right (secondary) input takes in the Trim Texture that the geometry should be mapped to. This should be prepared using the Trim Texture Utility node.

NOTE:
    To start using the tool, connect the inputs, select the node and hit enter to start using it.

TIP:
    Rightclicking in the viewport allows you to transform mode for the MMB key. Translate, Rotate, Scale, and Vertical and Horizontal adjustments.
