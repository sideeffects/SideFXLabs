""" Allows you to interactively place individual objects in a scene. """

This node allows you to interactively pick and place objects in a scene. The first input of the tool has the incoming collision geometry (your scene), and the second input has the objects you would like to place.

TIP:
   * Click and drag on the objects in the scene to place, scale and rotate them. 
   * Scrollwheel switches between the input objects to be placed.
   * CTRL+LMB Drag allows for tweaking of previously placed objects.
   * CTRL+SHIFT+LMB Drag allows changing scale and rotation of already placed objects.
   * CTRL+MMB Click removes previously placed objects.
   * RMB Click exposes a lot of placement controls.

TIP:
   It is highly recommended you plug in packed primitives as the geometry to place.


@parameters
    ID:
        The object number to be used for placement in this multiparm entry. The object number is calculated internally in the tool based on mesh connectivity.
    Align to Surface:
        This controls if the placed object gets aligned to the surface it got placed on.
