""" Create an outline of an object projected from either an axis, or from a camera. """

This tool generates a curve that matches the silhouette of an object when looking at it from either an axis, or from an orthographic camera.

@parameters
    Mode:
        Controls the type of output that should be generated. Silhouette creates an outline of the geometry, while contours will try and include some interior details too.
    Trace Axis:
        The projected axis for the output.
    Camera:
        A path to the camera that should be used when Trace Axis has been set to `Orthographic Camera`.
    Remove Outside of Silhouette:
        Enabling this will allow holes to be present in the generated mesh rather than purely producing a convex-like hull.
    Resample:
        Enabling this will resample the output curves uniformly based on the `Resample Length` parameter.
    Resample Length:
        The uniform length used for resampling the output.
