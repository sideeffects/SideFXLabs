"""Exports hair to Unreal Engine."""

[Image:/images/sidefxlabs_banner.jpg]

This node converts hair to alembic primitives suitable for import into Unreal
Engine. The output format matches the specification described here:
[Alembic for Grooms Specification|https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/WorkingWithContent/Hair/AlembicForGrooms]

@parameters

    == Groups ==

    Output Groups:
        #id: outputgroups
        Output group identifiers.

    Group Identifier:
        #id: groupidentifier
        The type of group identifier to output. UE4 only supports IDs. UE5 adds support for named groups corresponding to group IDs.

        Group ID:
            Output a basic integer id. Note that Unreal Engine simply creates a group for each unique value found and numbers them starting at 0. Whether you have group 0, 1, 2 or 1000, 2000, 3000 in Houdini - in Unreal engine you'll get 0, 1, 2 regardless.

        Group Name (UE5):
            Output custom-named groups. Only supported starting with UE5. Select this option if you have group names but do not have group IDs. This option will automatically generate group IDs from the name attribute.
			
		Group ID and Name:
			Output custom IDs and custom-named groups. IDs should only correspond to one name and vice versa.

    Group ID Attribute:
        #id: groupidattrib
        The houdini attribute to use as the integer group id.

    Group Name Attribute:
        #id: groupnameattrib
        The Houdini attribute to use as the group name.

    == Color ==

    Output Color:
        #id: outputcolor
        Output a color attribute

    Color Attribute:
        #id: colorattrib
        The name of the color attribute to use.

    == Output Guide IDs ==

    Output IDs:
        #id: outputids

	Output per-hair ids.

    From Attribute:
        #id: idsfromattrib

	Use an attribute for per-hair ids. When this is disabled, the primitive number is used as the id.

    ID Attribute:
        #id: idattrib
        The Houdini attribute to use for per-hair ids.
