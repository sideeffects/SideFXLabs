"""Creates simple 2D shapes."""

[Image:/images/sidefxlabs_banner.jpg]

This node creates simple 2D shapes. The base shapes are quadrilateral, triangle, n-gon/circle, and star, rendered as open or filled polygons. There are options for rounded corners, resampling the sides, automatic UV unwrap, and an option to cut a center hole with either an n-gon / circle or a custom shape.

This node replaces _Labs Star SOP_, which will be removed in Houdini 20.5.
