"""Merges disconnected Polylines together like the Polypath Sop, cutting them at intersections. 
But with specified conditions, while preserving and merging attributes and groups."""

The Merge splines node is able to merge together intersecting polylines while maintaining attributes and curve direction.
It works similar to the Poly path SOP’s base behaviour to cut and process polylines into segments. But it has 3 distinct functions the poly path lacks.

[Image:/images/merge_splines_splash.png]

- 1. You can specify how the geometry should be merged via groups and attributes.
- 2. It can propagate both primitive groups and attributes, as well as merge vertex attributes.
- 3. It has support for maintaining vertex order (curve direction), and can merge the vertex order of splines as if they were attributes.

Can be very useful when re-combining splines with attributes that need to be maintained.
Common use cases range from road network curves and paths to combining grids for pathfinding.


@parameters

    == Merge Splines == 

        *Configure how and which subsection of curves provided to the tool are merged.*

    Fuse / Snap Distance:    
        #id: fuseDistance
        Specify the snapping range of points to help connect disconnected polylines. Best to keep at reasonable levels, as over snapping can cause undesirable results.    

    Fuse Targets:
        #id: fuseTargets
        When enabled, only input spline ends with 1 neighbour point and optionally intersections with more than 2 neighbour points will be counted as fuse or merge targets. Spline points with only 2 neighbours will be ignored.
        
    Fuse Filter:
        #id: preFuseFilter
        Enables the options for a custom fuse filter, all points are fused by default when disabled.
        If input primitive lines are disconnected, select by point group which splines should be merged by their points. 
        If points between polylines are already connected and "Only Merge on Fuse Filter Selection" is enabled, only these points and their connected primitives will be merged, others will be left untouched.
        Otherwise, all connected geometry will be merged. Uses standard group syntax, such as * to select all the points in the input geometry.
        
    Only Merge on Fuse Filter Selection:
        #id: limitMergeOperations
        When a Fuse Filter point group is provided, only merge polylines connected to the "fuse filter" point selection, all other geometry is ignored. This is faster as only the affected geometry is re-calculated, while unaffected geometry is kept untouched. Useful when you need to merge curves into a much larger curve network without unnecessary overhead.
        
    Only Merge If Matching:
        #id: onlyMergeIfMatching
        Only merge curves that share one or multiple primitive attributes. Any differences in the specified attributes will prevent 2 polylines from being merged.    
        
    Attributes To Match:
        #id: attributeToMatch
        Specify the attribute names to match for merge. (Supported attribute types: Int, Float, String, Vector).

    == Advanced Fuse Behaviour ==

        *Configures how points are snapped when they are fused together.*

    Target Group:
        #id: targetgroup
        When enabled, this is the subset of points that will be snapped to points that are allowed to fuse. Otherwise, the fuse points are also the target group.
        
    Radius Attrib:
        #id: radiusattrib
        When enabled, the point attribute with this name is used to specify the radii of the points. Two points will be able to fuse together if the closest distance between their spheres with the corresponding radius is within the Snap Distance.

    Only Fuse when Primitive Attribute Matches:
        #id: onlyFuseIfMatching
        Only fuse points from curves that share a primitive attribute. Any differences in the specified attribute will prevent 2 polylines from being fused or snapped.
        
    Attribute to Match:    
        #id: attributeToMatchFuse
        Specify an attribute name to match for fusing. (Supported attributes: Int, Float, String, Vector)    
        
    Output Position:
        #id: positionsnapmethod
        The method to use to combine values of Position Attribute when snapping points together. If a "By Attribute" method is selected, use the specified point attribute to determine the snap position.
        
    Sort By Point Attrib:
        #id: pointFusePointOrder
        Specify a point attribute that will act as a weight to determine the points position to fuse to. (sorts by numerical or alphabetical order).
        
        
    == Primitive Behavior on Merge == 
        
        *Configures how primitive attributes & vertex order are resolved on curves that are merged together.*
        
    Prim Attrib Promotion:
        #id: primAttribMethod
        Specify how primitive attributes should be promoted upon merging 2 or more primitive polylines.

        The mean, or the sum of all matches divided by the number of matches.

        - *Mode* -
        The most common match. If there is more than one most common, it will be the minimum of the most common.

        - *Median* -
        The middle of the matches. If there is an even number of elements, it is the higher of the two possible middles.

        - *Sum* -
        All of the matches added together.

        - *Sum of Squares* -

        The square root of the average of the squares of all the matches.

        - *By Prim Number First Value* -
        The first valid primitive number per merge operation is taken for its attributes. You can pre-sort the primitives before providing them to the asset.

        - *By Prim Number Last Value* -
        The last valid primitive number per merge operation is taken for its attributes.  

        - *Array of All* -
        Provided the source attribute is a tuple attribute, a new array attribute is created. The array attribute is populated with all the values of the matches.    
        
        - *By Attribute First Value* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the attributes from the primitive with the lowest value. If multiple primitive share this lowest value, uses the first primitive number of this subset.
            
        - *By Attribute Last Value* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the attributes from the primitive with the highest value. If multiple primitive share this highest value, uses the first primitive number of this subset.
        
    Sort By:
        #id: primattrib
        When using "By Attribute" methods, all primitive attribute conflicts will be resolved by the order of this attribute value (numerical or alphabetical).
        
    Vertex Order Direction:
        #id: vertexOrderMethod
        Control how the Vertex Order is promoted for each merged primitive. By default, copies the vertex order of the First/Last prim number or attribute. Alternatively, it can match the primitive order, or use a separate attribute to set orientation.
        
        - *Match Prim Attrib Promotion* -
        Uses the Prim Attrib Promotion method to choose which primitive to sample the vertex order from. Methods that influence this are *Prim Number Match* methods and the *By Attribute Match* methods.
        
        - *By Attribute First Value* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the vertex order from the primitive with the lowest value. In case of matching values, picks the vertex order from the lowest primitive number.

        - *By Attribute Last Value* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the vertex order from the primitive with the highest value. In case of matching values, picks the vertex order from the lowest primitive number.
        
        - *By Attribute First Value / Reverse* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the vertex order from the primitive with the lowest value. In case of matching values, picks the vertex order from the highest primitive number.

        - *By Attribute Last Value / Reverse* -
        If a valid attribute name is specified, samples the vertex order from the primitive with the highest value. In case of matching values, picks the vertex order from the highest primitive number.   

        - *By Prim Number First Value* -
        The first valid primitive number per merge operation is taken for its vertex order.

@guides

*Guides become visible when the node is selected and help you understand how polylines are (or are not) merged together.*

[Image:/images/merge_splines_guide_legend.png]

- *Bright yellow arrows* indicate the vertex order of processed (or unprocessed) polylines.
- *Dark yellow arrows* indicate the original vertex order of pre-merged polylines, the bright yellow arrows are placed on these to indicate which was used for the final merged polyline.
- *Red arrows* indicate that the polyline ends at this point location and does not merge or connect with other polylines.
- *Green spheres* indicate that a point was merged and fused.
- *Orange spheres* indicate that a point was merged, but not fused ( Possible because the point was already fused with the participating primitives of the merge. )
- *Blue spheres* indicate a point was fused, but not merged ( Possibly due to it ending on an intersection. )

Guides are also provided from output 2 so you can implement them as a visual output of your tools.

NOTE:
    Internally, the asset uses groups and attributes prefixed with "temp_", if attributes or groups with this prefix are provided to the tool they will be removed.
