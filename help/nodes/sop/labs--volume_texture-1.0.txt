""" Take a volume as an input and export a texture of the density field. """

The Volume Texture Export is useful for converting volumes into textures that can be used in a realtime engine. Instead of creating a custom 3D texture, this outputs a 2D texture that can be read by all engines and then processed to be used as volumetric data at realtime.

Use the dropdown presets to match UE4's expected volume texture inputs.

Internally the volume is converted to the target output resolution. That means one voxel equals one pixel and the resulting volume is a cube.

NOTE:
    When exporting Density, make sure you are using a Fog VDB.

    When exporting SDF, make sure you are using a Distance VDB.

    When exporting Color, make sure you have a volume named `Cd`.

@parameters

    Render:
        #id: render
        Generate the texture.
    Valid Frame Range:
        #id: trange
        Use the dropdown to render a single frame or a sequence.
            
    Start/End/Inc:
        #id: f
        Start and End Frame as well as how many increments in between.
    Mode:
        #id: mode
        Select the mode which should be used for exporting the VolumeTexture.
        
	Density:
            Density will simply export the density values from your volume into a texture. All RGB values will have the same value.
        SDF:
            SDF will export your SDF as a texture, either raw or remapped to 0-1.
        Color:
            Color will export a volume named `Cd` to RGB, and optionally the `density` volume to A.
	Custom Vector Field:
            Custom Vector Field will take the specified vector field and convert it into a color field, which will export a volume named `Cd` to RGB, and optionally the `density` volume to A.
			
    Equalize Range:
        #id: equalizedensity
        When turned on this will remap the `density` values to exactly 0-1 range.
    Density in Alpha:
        #id: densityalpha
        When turned on this will export the `density` volume in the A channel when mode is set to Color.
    Invert Density:
        #id: invertdensity
        When turned on this will flip the values used for exporting density.
    Remap:
        #id: remap
        When mode is set to SDF this will enable remapping of values to 0-1. Use the `SDF Range` parameter to set the min and max values for the remap.
    SDF Range:
        #id: sdfrange
        Set the range from which your SDF should be remapped to 0-1.
    Custom Field Name:
        #id: customfield
        Name of the custom vector field to be converted into a color field named `Cd` for export.
        
        
    == Sampling ==

    Up Axis:
        #id: up_axis
        By default, the texture is exported with Z up to match UE4.            
    Frame Frozen:
        #id: frozenframe
        Optionally lets you export a specific frame in your frame range.
    Frame:
        #id: frame
        Sets the frame that should be exported.
    == Slicing ==

    Slices:
        #id: slices
        Sets the total number of slices that should be generated.
    Resolution per Slice:
        #id: frameresolution
        Sets the desired resolution per slice.
	Clipping Ratio:
		#id: clipping
		The ratio of clipping inside volume object when sampling.  
    == Output ==

    Preview:
        #id: preview
        Generate a preview of the texture in the viewport.
    Output Picture:
        #id: output_picture
        Path of exported image.
