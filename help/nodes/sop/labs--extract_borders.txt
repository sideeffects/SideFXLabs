""" Extract curves from Meshes """

This node converts models to curves, either by extracting the mesh boundaries as curves, or by splitting every point and outputting a wireframe version of the mesh. 

This is a simple wrapper around the Divide node, which isn't very discoverable. As well as Vertex Split and facet to provide additional functionality. 

@parameters
    As Curves:
        Unroll the Mesh and delete all primitives. 
        
    UV Borders:
        Toggles between outputting the geometry boundaries vs the UV boundaries. 
        
    Split All Points: 
        If outputting the geometry boundaries, split the mesh into all unique faces, which in turn gives you a wireframe representation of the model.
