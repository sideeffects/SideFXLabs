"""Scatters plant species points across the surface of an input heightfield by matching input plant types with their preferred environmental conditions."""

This node scatters plant species points defined by multiple _Labs Biome Plant Define SOPs_ chained together or a _Labs Biome Plant Definitions File SOP_ that is set to create geometry from a plant definitions file. These points contain attributes denoting their ideal conditions and tolerance level for factors including temperature and precipitation. The second input is a heightfield with biome attributes including temperature and precipitation, and other environmental attributes such as soil. This second input expects a heightfield generated by a _Labs Biome Attributes to Terrain SOP_ followed by a recommended _Labs Biome Attributes Evolve SOP_. This node inserts the plant and heightfield attributes into a viability function to determine the viability of a species in an area. The function produces a species viability heightfield layer per plant species and these layers control the scatter density of the plant species. After an initial plant scatter, plant species in close proximity to one another compete for resources, and the strongest survive while the weaker species are culled. The third input expects a heightfield mask or geometry to build a mask from. This mask is subtracted from the soil mask and will exclude the scatter from those areas. The first output is a point cloud source for instancing and the second output is the heightfield that can optionally include all of the plant viability layers when __Output Plant Viability Layers__ is enabled.  

@parameters

    Mode:
        #id: mode
        Controls if terrain points are scattered on the input terrain or a test terrain, or alternatively, if a simple line-up of the plant inventory is displayed. Scattering on test terrain or displaying the plant inventory modes are used for experimenting with plant species and biomes before a terrain environment has been defined. Scattering on input terrain requires an input terrain while the other modes do not. 
        <p>__Scatter on Input Terrain__: This mode scatters points onto the surface of the input heightfield based on the input heightfield layers: Temperature, Precipitation, and Soil.</p>            
        <p>__Scatter on Test Terrain__: This mode generates a test terrain with specified or existing biome attributes. Heightfield layers for Temperature and Precipitation are generated based on the Test Terrain parameters and Soil is filled with a value of 1. </p>            
        <p>__Display Plant Inventory__: This mode produces a line-up of each plant specie's mesh variants alongside their corresponding dead mesh variants.</p>
