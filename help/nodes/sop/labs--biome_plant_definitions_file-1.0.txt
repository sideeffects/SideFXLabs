= Labs Biome Plant Definitions File =

"""This node reads plant information from the disk file or writes to the disk file from input _Biome Plant Define SOP_ nodes."""

This node has two modes of operation. In __Write__ mode, the node reads the `plant_definition` dictionary attribute output by the _Biome Plant Define SOP_ nodes and writes that information to disk as a .bgeo or .json. In __Read__ mode, the node reads from the .bgeo or .json disk file, and generates geometry or a chain of _Biome Plant Define SOP_ nodes with the `plant_definition` dictionary attributes. It uses the user-defined __JSON Dictionary Key Mappings__ to write the keys of the JSON and these should remain constant to re-create the _Biome Plant Define_ nodes from it. When in __Read__ mode, __JSON Dictionary Key Mappings__ of this node should match those written in the file. For this reason, it is recommended to leave the key mappings as their default values.
