""" Generate a rubber band like rope around an object based on inputs. """

This node creates a rubber band like rope around your input object based on surfaces fed into the first input. It also allows you to specify the profile of the rope and the number of twists per unit. Additionally if desired you can also run a vellum simulation to get some draping and more realistic results.

@parameters
    == Curve ==
    Resolution:
        The resolution of the generated curve. A lower number will produce more divisions, while a higher number will produce less detail.
    Optimize Curves:
        When enabled, the tool will try to remove all inline points not required.
    Tolerance:
        The tolerance used when deciding if inline points should be removed during curve optimization. Lower value means preserving more detail.
    Simulated:
        When enabled, a vellum simulation will be run on the generated curves.
    Frames:
        Controls how many frames should be run in the vellum solver for the quasistatic result.
    == Geometry ==
    Style:
        Controls the shape of the profile used for sweeping.
    Diameter:
        Sets the uniform diameter of the generated ropes.
    Degrees Twist per Unit:
        Controls how many twists should happen per unit of rope. Configuring this parm will disable the ability to optimize the curves.
    Rows:
        Sets the number of rows used on the profile curve. Disabled when using custom profile in `Style`.
    Cusp Angle:
        Sets the cusp angle used when calculating vertex normals.
    == UV ==
    UV Scale:
        The scale modifier applied to the generated UVs.
    UV Rotation:
        The rotation applied to the generated UVs.
    == Optimization ==
    Optimize Surface:
        Turning this on will polyreduce the surface of the generated mesh.
    Percent to Keep:
        Controls the percentage of polygons to keep if `Optimize Surfaces` has been turned on.
    == Simulation Settings ==
    Mass:
        The uniform mass to be applied to the ropes during the vellum.
    Rest Length Scale:
        The rest length of the ropes during simulation. A vallue lower than 1 will result in behavior similar to a rubber band, whereas a value higher than one will cause more draping.
    Stretch Stiffness:
        Controls how much the generated constraints will try to preserve the rest position of the input curves.
    Bend Stiffness:
        Controls how much the generated constraints will try to preserve the rest position of the input curves.
