""" Spread a collection of shapes along an axis or grid. """

:video:

This node identifies individual shapes based on connectivity or attribute, and spread them along a user defined axis or grid. Controls are provided to select the method for identifying individual shapes, and the direction, spacing and sorting of the spread. This tool is great for inspecting geometry, or simply to generate contact sheets showing variations of multiple objects.

@parameters
    == Pieces ==
    Split By:
        How to identify elements to be distributed; by contiguous island (connectivity), or by an attribute.
    Sort By:
        Choose to not sort, or sort by name, or by size.
    Padding:
        Spacing applied between each element.
    Attribute Name:
        When `Split By` is set to `Piece Attribute`, this controls the attribute to split and align the geometry by.
    Axis Align: 
        Toggles an internal Axis Align SOP to locally each each piece
    X:
        How the individual pieces should be aligned on their local X axis.
    Y:
        How the individual pieces should be aligned on their local Y axis.
    Z:
        How the individual pieces should be aligned on their local Z axis.
    == Alignment == 
    Mode:
        Choose the type of alignment. Linear aligns objects along an axis, whereas Grid aligns them in a grid format.
    Axis:
        Determine which axis or plane the elements should be aligned along.
    Alignment:
        Determine if elements should be spread along the positive or negative direction of the selected axis.
