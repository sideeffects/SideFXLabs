""" Adding procedural damage on inputs """
 
== Overview ==
 
[Image:/images/edge_damage.jpg]

This node adds edge wear to your geometry. This is very useful to add some detail to geometry to for example make it look aged and damaged.
 
TIP:
   Try out the different types of edge damage to get different results.
 
@parameters
   Method:
	Allows you to modify the approach used to generate edge damage.
   Visualize Damage:
	Visualized the damage with a color.
   Seed:
	Global seed to get variation in the edge damage.
   Mask Attribute:
	Use an attribute to remove damage.
   


   == Damage Controls ==
           Amount:
		A scalar controlling how much damage is generated on the hard edges.
	   Resolution:
		Determines the resolution scale used before generating damage.
	   == Advanced ==
           Process Input:
		Applies mesh cleanup before generating damage.
           Direction:
		Controls the direction of the damage. A positive value means a buildup of material, whereas a negative number erodes.
           Mask Strength:
		Controls the intensity of the input mask used to art-direct the damage.
	   Cusp Angle:
		Sets the cusp angle of the generated normals for the damaged areas.
           Samples:
		Curvature intensity.
           Relax:
		Smoothing the geometry with noise.
           Curvature Tolerance:
		Tweaking the tolerance of the curvature values.
           Contrast:
		Increase the contrast of the curvature.
           Brightness:
		Boost the brightness level of the curvature.
           Ramp:
		Ramp to tweak the curvature value.
   == Voxelization ==
  	   Voxelize:
		Enables Voxelization of the input geometry.
  	   Voxel Size:
		Size of voxels. Lower value means higher quality.
           Smoothing Iterations:
		Smooth the voxels before converting it into geometry.
	   	== Advanced ==
  	   	Per Piece:
			Loop over each seperated input piece and voxelize it.
  	   	Create Piece Attribute:
			Create the piece attribute to loop over automatically based on connectivity.
  	   	Piece Attribute:
			This is the attribute to loop over.
  	   	Union:
			Boolean the input geometry before voxelization.
   == Displace ==
  	   Displacement:
		Displace the geometry based on the curvature.
  	   output_edge:
		Output the curvature in the color.
           Amount:
		The amount of the displacement.
		== Advanced ==
           	Blur:
			Blurring the edges of the damage. Can help smoothing out hard edges.
           	Blurring Range:
			Increase the radius around the edges of the displacement to blur.
           	Sharpen:
			Blend between sharpened version of the model and the default output.
           	Sharpening Iterations:
			Number of iterations to sharpen.
   == Noise ==
  	   Noise:
		Adding a noise on the curvature value.
           Center Noise:
		Centers the noise values around zero.
           Height:
		Controls the strength of the noise.
           Element Size:
		Size of the noise.
           Noise Type:
		Menu for selecting multiple noises.
           Roughness:
		Roughness of the noise.

   == Post Processing ==
      Post Blur:
          Blur the result of the edge damage.
      Normal:
	  Set the cusp angle for the exported normals.
      Extract Largest Piece:
	  Extract the largest geometry piece and only output that.


@outputs
   Output1:
	Geometry with edge damage based on the input.
