""" Automatic Trim Texturing node. """

This node is the interactive version of the Trim Texture node.
The tool takes in two inputs. The left (primary) input takes in the geometry you would like to Trim. It does not need UVs.
The right (secondary) input takes in the Trim Texture that the geometry should be mapped to. This should be prepared using the Trim Texture Utility node.

TIP:
    A good workflow would be to automatically trim the geometry, and then use the interactive tool to make final tweaks.

@parameters
    Group:
        A primitive group selection that should be processed.
    == UV Generation ==
    Generate UVs:
        Controls if UVs should be generated, or if existing UVs should be used.
    Rectify UVs:
        Controls if UV Shells should be rectified before processing. Useful for curved geometry.
    Edge Cutting Angle:
        Controls at what angle an edge is considered hard and should generate a UV seam.
    == Fitting Properties ==
    Fitting Preference:
        Controls the preference of how UV shells should be biased when making a decision on what the best match is on the Trim Texture.
    Area:
        Controls how much the difference in area between source and target shell matters.
    Limit Texel Density Error:
        Controls if texel density differences matter when deciding if a mapped shell is bad.
    Visualize Error:
        Enabling this toggle will color all bad matches red.
    Max Texel Density Error:
        Controls how big of a fraction the texel density is allowed to be before it is considered bad. 0.3 on a 512 texture for example is a mismatch of ~150 pixels 
    == Trim Groups ==
    Tileable Trims:
        Controls which primitives on the Trim Texture are tileable on the U (X) axis. Any UV shells wider than 1.0 will be eligible to be mapped on there.
    Reserved Trims:
        Controls which primitives on the Trim Texture should not be mapped to.
