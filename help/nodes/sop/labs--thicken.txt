""" Extrudes a mesh along it's averaged normals """

Simple Helper node that will extrude a mesh along it's averaged normals. 

Giving a mesh thickness is an easy way for ensuring something is water tight and will play well with collision and physics. 

But simply using the PolyExtrude SOP usually has some downfalls. It is easy for complex geometry to crash onto itself, and it you usually need several nodes if you need to extrude something both ways in order to give it thickness. 

This node is a simple collection of other common used nodes to ensure you can take something like a curve, and generate something with thickness in a single node. 

@parameters
    Depth:
        Distance to Extrude
    Both Directions:
        Toggle for extruding outwards as well as inwards. 
    Dissolve Middle Edge:
        When extruding in both directions, remove the edge that joins both halves. 
    Reduce Back Side:
        Toggle for PolyReducing the "Inside" Faces. Useful if you have a dense mesh and just need thickness but don't care about the detail inside. 
    Reduction Percentage:
        How much to reduce the inside faces. 0 means reduce as much as possible, 100 means no reduction.
