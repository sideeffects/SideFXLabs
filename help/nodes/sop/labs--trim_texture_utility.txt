""" Helps preparing trim texture geometry for a Trim Texture workflow """

This node helps preparing trim texture geometry for a Trim Texture workflow. This tool is useful for both the automatic and the interactive Trim Textures tool.

@parameters
    Trim Texture:
        The color map to be used for the trim texture. This texture will be assigned to the trim geometry.
    == Initialization ==
    Visualize Strips:
        Enabling this will assign a unique color to all individually connected strips.
    Initialization Mode:
        This controls how the Trim Texture should be initialized. From input will use the incoming geometry, while Generate from ID map will use an ID map to generate a Trim Texture from it.
    Use Connectivity:
        Enabling this will use 3D connectivity between polygons to determine what primitives belong to a strip. Disabling this will just generate one per polygon.
    Initialize:
        When Initialization Mode is set to From Input, pressing this button will populate the multiparm with trim strips.
    ID Map:
        The map to be used for generating individual trim strips based on color. Only works when Initialization Mode is set to Generate from ID Map.


    == Trim == 
    Selection:
        A selection to be considered a single trim.
