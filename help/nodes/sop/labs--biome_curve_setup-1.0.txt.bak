= Labs Biome Curve Setup (Beta) =

"""This node sets the necessary attributes on curves created in Houdini to use with _Labs Biome Initialize SOP_."""

Instead of the biome interface handled through _Labs Biome Initialize_ for all other region assignment methods, this node assigns the necessary attributes to curves as they are created. The first input is the corresponding curve, and the second input is the Previous _Biome Curve Setup_ SOP in the chain. For curves that can share a biome assignment, it is possible to merge them together first before wiring into the first input.


@parameters

    == Curve Setup ==

    Biome Name:
        #id: biomename_curve
	The biome to assign this region. To adjust biome names, settings, or add/delete biomes, see [Labs Biome Adjust Settings|Node:sop/labs--biome_adjust_settings].
        
    Biome Hierarchy:
        #id: biomehierarchy
	The priority to assign to the associated curve(s). A higher number will give the biome priority when using Biome Overlap resolution on the [Labs Biome Initialize|Node:sop/labs--biome_initialize] SOP.
        
    Create Next :
        #id: createnext
	Creates the _Biome Curve Setup_ node for the next curve region and connects the related wires.
