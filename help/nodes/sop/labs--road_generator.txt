""" Generate roads from curves or OSM data """
 
 
This node generates roads from curves, and will handle intersecting curves and create crossings automatically. A good use for the tool is with OSM data.
 
TIP:
   Make sure input curves either have a good width attribute or none at all. The tool works best with real world scale inputs. [Tutorial on the tool| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4max8Tdj15k]
 
@parameters
    == General ==
    Width Scalar:
        Scales the width of the road.
    == Road Module Settings ==
    Custom Module:
        Custom modules for the straight sections of the road can be provided here.
    Module Width:
        Scale the custom module road pieces.
    Module Length:
        Spacing between road modules.    
    == Intersection Settings ==
    Road Length:
        The max length of the intersection of the solved road.
    Roundness:
	The amount of roundness created in the intersections.
    Convexity:
	Controls the convexity of the intersection.
    Resolution:
	This will increase the resolution used in generating the intersection. Higher value means more polygons.
    UV scale:
	Controls the UV scale on the generated roads.
    == Advanced ==
    Bridge Support:
       Allows for the generation of bridges if a bridge attribute has been found on OSM data.
    Visualize Type:
       Visualize the different types of geometry generated with colors. 
 
@outputs
   Road Geometry:
       Outputs the generated road geometry.
   Road Lines:
       Output the sidelines of the road that could be used to make sidewalks.
   Point Cloud:
	A point cloud which can be used for instancing road modules.
