""" Physics Painter is a SOP that allows users to paint physics objects onto any other object. """

This node allows users to paint physics objects onto any other object, and simulate gravity. The result of the previous simulation can be fed into a new iteration of a simulation as often as required.

This is a very powerful node frequently used for setdressing. Instead of scattering objects, this tool allows an artist to highly art-direct objects in a scene.

@parameters
    Dry Current Paint:
        Pressing this button will convert all current active (green) objects from a simulation state to a frozen static state.
    Clear Current Paint:
        This will clear out all currently active objects from your scene.
    Activate All Paint:
        This will reactivate all previously frozen simulation objects in your scene back to an active state.
    Clear All Paint:
        Pressing this button will completely erase all previously painted simulation geometry. This cannot be undone.
    == Quick Settings ==
    Paint Bucket Mode:
        When this toggle is enabled, the paint brush will stamp buckets of objects rather than single objects along your strokes.
    Bucket Items:
        When Paint Bucket Mode is enabled, this controls how many items are contained inside each stamped bucket.
    Stroke Padding:
        The stroke padding controls how much padding is applied between each "stamp" of simulation meshes along the stroke.
    Surface Offset:
        This allows you to offset the drawn simulation meshes on your curve from the static geometry.
    Min Rotation:
        This controls the minimum value of the initial rotation range.
    Max Rotation:
        This controls the maximum value of the initial rotation range.
    Min Scale:
        This controls the minimum value of the initial scale range.
    Max Scale:
        This controls the maximum value of the initial scale range.
    == Objects ==
    Quick Add:
        Adding a path to a node in this parameter will automatically add said object to the objects to be painted with in the multiparm below.
    Sim Mesh:
        This is the geometry for this paint object that should be used for the simulation mesh. (This can be a proxy)
    Render Mesh:
        This allows you to replace the simulated mesh with a high resolution object. This allows you to do the simulation using a low-resolution proxy, but have an output of a final high quality render mesh.
    Weight:
        This weight is used for the randomization of the paint objects along the stroke curve. This is not a percentage, but a value relative to other paint object weights. (Weighted Random)
