""" Does a boolean on a polycurve. """

This node wraps the network of Intersection Analysis and Intersection Stitch and Group logic into a convenient simple to use node. 

NOTE:
    The first input should be a polycurve, and the second input should be primitives.

@parameters
    == Output Geometry ==
    Operation:
        Controls the type of boolean that should be done. Subtract removes all the parts of a polycurve provided in input A that are inside a piece of geometry provided in input B. Intersect returns the overlap between input A and B. Shatter simply cuts the input curve from A by input B.
    Edge Length Threshold:
        The minimum length edges have to be where the cutting surface intersects with already existing point on the input curve before they get collapsed into the generated intersection points.
    == Groups ==
    A inside B:
        Sets the name to be used for the group that contains primitives originally part of A inside B. (The intersection)
    A outside B:
        Sets the name to be used for the group that contains primitives originally part of A outside B. (The outsides)
