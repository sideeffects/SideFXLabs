""" Create a tube from a curve, with uvs and normals. """

The cylinder generator wraps up some common functionality for generating tubes for realtime vfx. You can quickly set the inner and outer radius, modify the profile and add noise to shape the tube for multiple usecases. UV's are automatically laid out and adjusted with override controls. Add vertex colour based on u or v to drive material parameters in your game engine.

@parameters

    Inner Radius:
        #id: innerradius
    Defines the radius of the inner and bottom circle for the cylinder.

    Outer Radius:
        #id: outerradius
    Defines the radius of the outer and top circle for the cylinder.

    Sides:
        #id: sides
	Determines the number of sides the cylinder will have.

    Segments:
        #id: segments
    Determines the number of polygon segments the cylinder has along its height.

    Arc Start:
        #id: arcstart
    Determines the starting point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis the cylinder is oriented.

    Arc End:
        #id: arcend
    Determines the ending point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis the cylinder is oriented.

	Height:
		#height
	Determines the size of the cylinder in the axis that is oriented.

    Enable Ramp:
        #id: enableramp
    Uses a multiplier and a ramp to change the height profile of the cylinder.

    Ramp Multiplier:
        #id: rampmultiplier
    Multiplies the effect of the curve ramp that is being used.

    Curve Ramp:
        #id: curveramp
    Applies the ramp to modify the height profile of the cylinder.

	End Caps:
        #id: endcaps
	Creates triangular caps for the open ends of the cylinder.

    Add UVs:
        #id: adduvs
	Generates and connects a Labs UV Unwrap Cylinder SOP to unwrap uvs.

    Orientation:
        #id: orientation
	Orientation of the shape.

    Translate:
        #id: translate
	Location of the center of the shape.
