""" Example HDA from the Rebirth Project to generate Sci Fi Panneling """

This node was designed specifically for our GDC Demo with Quixel, but there was enough interest on how it was done that we decided to release it as is for reverse engineering purposes. 

It makes heavy usage of the [Lot Subdivision SOP|Node:sop/labs--lot_subdivision] with some extra beveling and notching added for flavor.

== Tips/Hints ==

- check that your UVs are not flipped. you can do that by adding a uv quickshade and check whether uv's are flipped, if they are, add a uv transform of scale -1 on x and make sure they are correct. If they are flipped the node will fail.

- everything really starts with your uv, Make sure its good (not 1000 small pieces), and make sure there is spacing between islands. A default uvlayout is not good enough on more complicated things, increase the island spacing within the uvlayout sop to get it working.

- sometimes the island spacing is just not enough, and you need to add a uv transform and scale the uv's. Be careful here, do small numbers, ad large values here take considerable time to calculate. something like 3 or 5 was sufficient in our tests.

- make sure, that based on your object scale, the minimum lot size parameter is actually achievable

@parameters 
    == Global Settings ==
	UV Generation:
		Select between input UVs and auto-generated UVs  
		<p>*Use Input UVs*: Uses incoming vertex UVs</p>
		<p>*Auto Generate UVs*: Overrides incoming UVs with a Flatten </p>
    Pattern Rotation:
        Angle of the cutting pattern
    Border Thickness:
        Padding around the panels (Part of the Sci Fi Look)
    Global Seed:
        Randomization Control
    Thickness:
        Depth of the notch cut
    Panel Deletion Chance:
        Percentage (0-100) of chance that a panel will be deleted. 100 means all panels will be gone, 0 means no panel will be deleted
    Deletion Seed:
        Randomization control of the deletion for fine tuning
    Enable Random Vertex Colors:
        Add Vertex Colors to Panels
    Seed:
        Randomization control for vertex colors
    Vertex Colors:
        Distribution of the color ratio
    == Lot Division ==
    Irregularity:
        Smaller values mean the cuts will be halfway along a primitive, higher values will yield primitives of different sizes. 
    Minimum Lot Size:
        Primitives smaller than this size will no longer be considered for cutting
    Vertical Bias:
        Negative numbers will generate horizontal slivers, Positive numbers will generate vertical slivers
    Alignment:
        Method of orientating the cuts. Bounding box is for worldspace cutting, longest edge is relative to the shape. 
    Cluster Lots:
        Enables joining of lots into clusters
    Number of Clusters:
        Final Number of Lots after merging them into clusters
    Vertical Packing:
        Strength on a Gradient that clumps lots together towards the top (or bottom)
    == Padding ==
    Spacing:
        Padding in between panels
    Spacing Variation:
        Randomization of the padding between panels
    == Notches ==
    Percentage:
        Chance for an edge to be booleaned by a sci fi notch shape
    Deviation:
        Slide the notch along the edge (from the center)
    Length:
        Length of the notch
    Notches Seed:
        Randomness for Notch 
    == Corner Bevels ==
    Corner Bevels Chance:
        Chance to lop off a corner (0-100)
    Corner Bevels Depth:
        Depth of the Corner Cut
