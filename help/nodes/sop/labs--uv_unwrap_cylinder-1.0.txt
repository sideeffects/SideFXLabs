"""Unwraps cylindrical shaped meshes."""

[Image:/images/sidefxlabs_banner.jpg]

The Labs UV Unwrap Cylinder SOP automatically unwraps cylindrical-shaped meshes in strips.
This can also be done manually by selecting the edges that will act as seams and the cylinder’s end caps.

The end result is ideal to use in a trim texture workflow.
