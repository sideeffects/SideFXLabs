""" Automatically Generates UV Attributes """

One of our top nodes in our toolset. 

Several different methods for automatically generating UVs on input meshes. 


@parameters
    == Method ==
    UV Attribute:
        Name of the output attribute
    Method:
        Algorithm used to generate the UVs
        
    === Shortest Path ===
    The Shortest Path method, will identify areas of high curvature on a mesh and then draw shortest paths between those points. 
    
    Collapse Distance:
        Fuse Threshold in case paths are too close together
    Number of Paths:
        Number of high curvature points to use as path points
    Convex Multiplier:
        Attract the seams based on high convexity (helpful for hard surface models) 
    Occlusion Multiplier:
        Attract the seams based on Ambient Occlusion (helpful for organic models)
        
    === Cluster ===    
    Clusters primitives based on position and normal attributes to generate islands  
    
    Number of Clusters:
        Number of Islands to be generated
    Normal Blur:
        Blur the Normals a bit when considering which normals are close together (will merge islands together)
    Random Seed:
        Randomly change the clustering
        
    === UV Unwrap ===   
    Use the build in UV Unwrap node. While usually not the best solution, this combined with Merge Small Islands is generally one of the best solutions. 
    
    Planes:
        Number of Projection Planes. 
        
    === UV AutoSeam ===   
    Use the new [UV Autoseam|Node:sop/uvautoseam] node  
    
    Grain Tolerance:
        When Splitting is "Curvature based", controls how sensitive grains are to changes in normal direction across surfaces. A value of zero is very sensitive and produces tiny grains. Larger values up to 1 are less sensitive and produce larger grains.
    Merge Threshold:
        Controls how often smaller grains merge to become larger islands. 0 never merges (giving the initial grains as output), 1 merges all connected grains together (giving no seams in the output). You can tweak this control, centering around 0.5, to get more or fewer seams.
        
        
    == Packing Options ==
    Merge Small Islands:
        Consolidates Small UV Islands into Larger Neighbors
    Small Island CutOff:
        Size threshold of the islands that will be merged back into larger pieces
    Optimize UV Border:
        Attempts to cleanup triangles that are sticking to the side of the UV island. May cause small islands to reappear
    Flattening Method:
        Defines how to flatten the Islands. 
    Orientation Mode:
        How to rotate the islands when packing 
    Packing Iterations:
        How many times to attempt fitting the islands together 
    Island Padding:
        How many pixels to pad the islands by 
    Padding Resolution:
        Reference Resolution for Island Padding
