""" Converts Attributes to Groups """

Generated Groups based on Attribute Values. 

Handy for grouping things based on materials, or other attributes. 

NOTE: 
    The generated Group Name is actually the value of the attribute, not the attribute name. 
    
    
NOTE: 
    This has similar functionality to the [Partition SOP|Node:SOP/partition] but without having to deal with expressions. 

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of the geometry from which to get the attribute to generate groups from.
    Attribute Type:
        Component Type for this attribute.
    Attribute Name:
        Name of the Attribute that we would like to use to generate groups from.
    Group Prefix:

    Precision:
