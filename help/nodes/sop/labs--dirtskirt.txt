""" Create a geometry 'skirt' where an object and ground plane intersect, to be used as a soft blend in a game engine. """

This node creates dirt shirts where an object and a ground plane intersects.

@parameters
    == Object Skirt ==
    Distance:
        Distance on the object the skirt will reach
    Noise Frequency:
        Noise on the object portion of the skirt. High Frequency means tighter noise 
    Noise Intensity:
        Strength of the noise on the object portion of the skirt
    == Ground Skirt ==
    Distance:
        Distance on the ground the skirt will reach
    Noise Frequency:
        Noise on the ground portion of the skirt. High Frequency means tighter noise 
    Noise Intensity:
        Strength of the noise on the ground portion of the skirt    
    == Tweak Parameters ==
    Relaxation Iterations:
        Amount to relax the inner surface of the skirt. Higher values will even out the topology, creating a softer blend.
    Ground Offset:
        Vertical height to offset start of dirt skirt above the ground geometry. 
    Rotate X:
        Rotation on X to slump the dirt skirt higher on +Z or -Z.
    Rotate Z:
        Rotation on Z to slump the dirt skirt higher on +X or -X.
    Add Vertex Color:
        When enabled will add a gradient to the edges of the dirt skirt. When exported to a game engine this can be used as alpha fade, or a mask to blend between materials used for the object and the ground.
    == Clean Up ==
    Target Polycount:
        Total amount of polygons to be used in the skirt, default is 1000.
    Delete Small Area Threshold:
        Area threshold used to identify small triangles and delete them.
    Z Offset:
        Amount to push all points along their normals, to avoid intersections with the ground or object mesh.
    Keep Ground Mesh:
        When enabled will include the ground mesh in the output geometry.
    Keep Object Mesh:
        When enabled will include the object mesh in the output geometry.
