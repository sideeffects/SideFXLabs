""" Utility SOP to store the filename of a file SOP as its detail attributes to be then used in other SOPs. """

This utility SOP makes extracting filenames from files imported with a file sop very easy. This is extremely useful when processing large number of meshes in batch, and you want to utilize file names for ex baking outputs.

NOTE:
    The tool requires a file sop to be plugged in as the direct node above it in order to function properly when using the default input mode.
