""" Converts an Edge Group to a Poly Curve """

Edge Groups are a handy way of defining curves, but the process of extracting them from a mesh is not trivial, until now. 

This node will take an Edge Group, and convert it into a PolyCurve.

It will also provide an additional option to give the extracted curve some thickness. Useful for visualizing UV seams and other screenshotting purposes.

@parameters
    Group:
        Edge Group to Extract 
    Connect End Points:
        Connect curves that have overlapping ends into a single curve. 
    == Thickness ==
    Enable:
        Toggles doing a Sweep on the generated curve in order to give it some thickness
    Mode:
        Toggles between a Sweep or a PolyWire on the generated curve. PolyWire handles intersections better then the Sweep
    Divisions:
        Controls the resolution of the swept circle 
    Color:
        Vertex Color on the generated mesh
    Thickness:
        How Wide is the generated mesh
