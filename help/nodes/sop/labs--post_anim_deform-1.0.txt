"""Apply modeling changes to deforming geometry"""

This node provides a method of applying modeling changes to deforming geometry. The local-space changes will move with the deforming geometry, in a predictable way.
This node can be used for "finalizing" workflows. Rather than resimulate a cloth or skin simulation you can make adjustments with this node and blend them back into the original animation.

NOTE: 
    In order for this node to work it needs to have a normal attribute and the polygons can not be degenerate.

@parameters

    Normal Attribute:
        #id: normal
        This specifies the incoming normal attribute the node should be using. This is used to compute the appropriate transformation matrices. 
        
    Transform Attribute:
        #id: xform
        The node uses an internally created attribute to transform the geometry. The default value uses the nodes name to minimize the chances of there being a naming conflict with an incoming attribute
        
    Attributes To Transform:
        #id: attribtotrans
        Here we can specify which attributes need to be transformed. The defaults assumes that you want to transform the position and normal.
        
    Export Transform Attribute:
        #id: deletexform
        Option to delete or preserve the transformation attribute. Note: You might want to apply the transformation after the fact in combination with other transformations which is why you might want to preserve the attribute and not transform the geometry. 
             
    Transform Geometry:
        #id: dotransform
        Option to apply the transformation or not.
