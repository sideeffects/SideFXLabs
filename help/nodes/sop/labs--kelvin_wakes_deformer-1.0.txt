"""Deforms input geometry in the shape of water wakes that form behind objects
moving at a constant speed."""

[Image:/images/kelvin_wakes_deformer.png]

_Kelvin wakes_ refer to the steady-state wave patterns that develop behind
objects moving on water at a constant speed. Shapes of these wakes do not
change, but they are dragged continually by motion of the floating body. This
node generates such wakes; it can be used to cheaply emulate waves from a ship
or ripple patterns that emerge behind floating characters.

First input to this SOP is the geometry that will be deformed. The
__Deformation Target__ parameter must be set according to the type of this
input: __Points__ or __Heightfield__. In either case, deformation is done in the
plane perpendicular to __Up Axis__.

Second input to the Kelvin Wakes Deformer SOP must contain the objects that
generate the wakes. When __Input__ is set to __Objects as Points__, points of
this geometry each represent a floating body whose constant velocity is expected
in the `v` attribute. For a turning object, the path must be converted to a
curve and __Input__ set to __Trajectory Curve__. In this mode, only a single
curve is accepted at a time--but wakes from more objects can be added by
chaining multiple nodes.

NOTE:
    Although this node produces correct results for gentler turns, it may have
    trouble at higher curvatures or when different parts of the curve are in
    close proximity.


@parameters

    Up Axis:
        #id: normal
        Deformation is done in the plane perpendicular to this axis. That is,
        coordinates of each point are projected to this plane before the
        deformation function is calculated.
        
    Gravity:
        #id: gravity
        Acceleration due to gravity. Larger values of __Gravity__ result in less
        deformation and smaller wavelengths for the generated waves.
        
    Deformation Target:
        #id: target
        Type of geometry to deform. The value of this parameter must correspond
        to the type of the first input.

    Input:
        #id: input
        Specifies type of the second input. When set to __Objects as Points__,
        each point will generate a wake behind it based on its velocity (stored
        in the `v` attribute). When set to __Trajectory Curve__, a single curve
        is expected representing the object's path.

        NOTE:
            The curve is linearly extrapolated beyond its endpoints. That is,
            the object is assumed to move in a straight line before reaching the
            curve (before __Curve Start Frame__) and after hitting its end.
        
    Curve Start Frame:
        #id: curvestart
        When __Input__ is set to __Trajectory Curve__, the object will reach the
        beginning of the curve at this frame.
        
    Traversal Speed:
        #id: speed
        Speed at which the object traverses its path. With a larger
        __Traversal Speed__, the object will move along the curve faster and
        generate waves of longer wavelength.

        NOTE:
            This operator works with the assumption that objects move with a
            constant speed; thus, this parameter cannot be animated.
        
    Supersample:
        #id: supersample_dx
        Distance calculations may be blocky near turns, and supersampling can
        help to mitigate this. Turn this feature on if you notice blockiness in
        the pattern. The distance should be set large enough to smooth out the
        problematic areas, but small enough to avoid larger scale distortion.
        
    == Falloffs ==

    Edge Blend:
        #id: edgeblend
        The amount of flattening near outer edges of the wake. Larger values
        perform more gradual blending, but may deteriorate the internal pattern.
        
    Suppress Radius:
        #id: suppress_radius
        The amount of flattening near the generating body. This is required to
        remove unphysical spikes close to the object.
        
    Attenuate by Distance:
        #id: enable_falloff
        When enabled, heights of waves farther from the generating object are
        reduced.
        
    Falloff Range is Relative to Speed:
        #id: relative_falloff
        When this is turned on (along with __Attenuate by Distance__), values in
        the __Falloff Range__ will be relative to the object's speed; that is,
        bodies that are moving faster will have longer wakes. If
        __Falloff Range is Relative to Speed__ is disabled, values in the
        __Falloff Range__ represent absolute distances.
        
    Falloff Range:
        #id: falloff_range
        Controls the distance at which the disturbances behind the boat are
        attenuated, when __Attenuate by Distance__ is turned on.
        
    == Spectrum ==

    Magnitude Multiplier:
        #id: magnitude_multiplier
        Controls the overall amplitude of the wakes.
        
    Magnitude Ramp:
        #id: magnitude_ramp
        Determines magnitudes of the wave coefficients at each angle. Values
        near the middle and endpoints of this ramp control _transverse_ and
        _divergent_ components, respectively. _Transverse_ waves face in the
        same direction as the object, while _divergent_ components are
        responsible for the patterns that emerge near wake edges. Left and right
        sides of this ramp correspond to the respective sides of the wake.
        
    Phase Offset:
        #id: phase_offset
        A global phase offset for the wave coefficients. Changing this value 
        will shift the wake pattern without changing the shape.
        
    Phase Ramp:
        #id: phase_ramp
        Determines phases of the wave coefficients at each angle. You can use
        this ramp to tweak the look of the waves without affecting the overall
        shape. Left and right sides of this ramp correspond to the respective
        sides of the wake.

    == Output ==
       
    Displacement:
        #id: outputdispattrib
        When enabled, the specified point attribute will store the amount of
        displacement at each point. Only available when __Deformation Target__
        is set to __Points__.

    Deformation Mask:
        #id: outputmaskattrib
        When enabled, the specified point attribute will store the mask applied
        at each point. This mask is calculated using parameters under the
        __Falloffs__ section. Only available when __Deformation Target__ is set
        to __Points__. When __Input__ is __Objects as Points__, the exported
        value corresponds to the mask from the closest object.

    Local Coordinates:
        #id: outputcoordattrib
        When enabled, the specified point attribute will store the
        two-dimensional local coordinate of each point with respect to the
        floating body. First coordinate is aligned with motion of the object,
        while the second is perpendicular. Only available when
        __Deformation Target__ is set to __Points__. When __Input__ is
        __Objects as Points__, the exported value corresponds to coordinates in
        the frame of the closest object.

    Height Layer:
        #id: heightlayer
        Name of the layer to adjust when __Deformation Target__ is set to
        __Heightfield__.
