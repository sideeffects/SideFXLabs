<This node analyzes input images and generates regions that reflect the major shapes defined by the colored areas of the image.>


@parameters

    == Input ==

    Image Path:
		File path to an input image. 
        #id: imginput
        
    COP Network:
		Link to a COP Network to use. Remember to set the Render flag on the COP node you wish to use from the network.
        #id: copinput
        
    == Region Generation ==

    Number of Colors:
		Number of dominant colors to extract from the image.
        #id: numcolors
        
    Region Smoothing:
		Amount of smoothing to apply to the regions.
        #id: strength
        
    === Neighbor Consolidation ===

    Extended Influence:
		Search distance to attempt to look for primitive neighbors when consolidating.
        #id: extweight
        
    Iterations:
		Number of times to attempt to consolidate primitive neighbors.
        #id: iterations
        
    Generate Regions:
		Generate polygonal regions from color clusters. Some operations will generate regions automatically.
        #id: generatecolors
        
    Add Custom Attribute:
		Add custom attribute to generated regions.
        #id: addatt
        
    Attribute Name:
		Name given to custom attribute.
        #id: attname
        
    Type:
		Attribute type.
        #id: atttype

            
    Add Index Attribute:
		Expose index attribute of generated regions.
        #id: addindex
        
    Attribute Name:
		Name given to index attribute.
        #id: attname2
        
    === Extracted Regions ===

    Visualization Color:
		Visualize average color of consolidated regions. Color can be changed, but will be regenerated with parameter changes.
        #id: extcolor#
        
    Attribute Value:
		Value to give custom attribute corresponding to specified region.
        #id: attvalue#
