@parameters

    == Parallel Processing ==

    Partition By:
        #id: partitionby
	Connectivity and Bucket Size will have options to partition by connectivity, UV islands, and clusters of primitives. Custom Attribute partitions geometry by a custom primitive integer attribute.
        
    === Connectivity ===

    3D Connectivity:
        #id: connectivity
	Partitions geometry based on individual connectivity.
        
    3D and UV Connectivity:
        #id: uvislands
	Partitions and geometry based on separate UV islands. Remeshing by connectivity is included in this option.
        
    Bucket Size:
        #id: bucketsize
	Partitions geometry by clustering primitives.
        
    Target Bucket Size:
        #id: targetbucket
	The target number of polygons in each cluster. A lower value will generate more clusters.
        
    Bucket Seed:
        #id: clusterseed
	Randomize geometry clusters.
        
    Attribute Name:
        #id: customattname
	The name of the custom primitive integer attribute used to partition geometry.
        
    Visualize Partitions:
        #id: visualizepieces
	Assigns a random color to each partition.
        
    == Remesh ==

    Remesh Target Type:
        #id: remeshtarget
	__Target Edge Length__
	
	__Target Polycount__
	
	__Ratio of Average Input Edge Length__
	
	__Ratio of Input Polycount__
	
	__Adaptive Remeshing__
		
    Target Edge Length:
        #id: targetedgetemp
	Target length (in Houdini units) of resulting triangle edge lengths.
        
    Edge Length Ratio:
        #id: edgemult
	Ratio of the target edge length to the average input edge length. A ratio of 2 will make edge lengths twice as long.
        
    Target Polycount:
        #id: targetpolycount
	Target polycount goal for resulting mesh. Higher remesh iterations will more closely reach this goal.
        
    Polycount Ratio:
        #id: polymult
	Ratio of the target polycount to the input polycount. A ratio of 2 will double the amount of polygons.
		
        
    === Adaptive ===

    Target Edge Length Min:
        #id: targetlengthmin
	Minimum target edge length.
        
    Target Edge Length Max:
        #id: targetlengthmax
	Maximum target edge length.
        
    Gradation:
        #id: gradation
	The rate at which edge lengths are allowed to change from one triangle to the next. Higher values generate fewer triangles but the overall quality is lower.
        
    Remesh Iterations:
        #id: remeshiterations
	Increasing this increases the quality of the generated mesh but takes more time. More iterations will produce triangles that are more equilateral. Increasing this parameter while performing Adaptive remeshing may cause holes in geometry.
        
    Smoothing:
        #id: smoothing
	The amount of additional smoothing to apply after remeshing.
        
    == Post-processing ==

    Remesh Seams:
        #id: remeshseams
	Resulting seams can be visible in the resulting mesh, especially in adaptive remeshing. Remesh Seams only remeshes these affected areas, blending them into the whole mesh.
        
    Fuse Remaining Seams:
        #id: fusepieces
	Fuses remaining partitions into a complete mesh.
        
    Recompute Normals:
        #id: recomputenormals
	Recalculates the normals of output geometry.
