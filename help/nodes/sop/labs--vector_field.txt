""" Export a vector field, compatible with Unreal Engine. """

Vector Fields can be used to drive particles in Unreal. The ROP exports a compatible fga file that stores a velocity field. 

NOTE:
    The tool is built to export Houdini volumes, and will auto-convert VDB to native volumes. It is however recommended to do this yourself for maximum control.

@parameters
    Output File:
        The path to the generated fga file.
    Input Type:
        Volume:
            Use a volume with vel fields as the input.
        Particles:
            Use a point cloud with the attribute v as the input.
    Velocity Volumes:
        Set the field from the input volume to be used for export. Generally this is vel.*
    Velocity Attribute:
        Set the attribute from the input point cloud to be used for export.
    Override Resolution:
        If the input is a volume, the resulting resolution of the vector field can be changed. Remember, larger resolution require more memory and degrade performance at runtime.
    Sampling Divs:
        Set the resolution of the resulting vector field when using a point cloud as the input.
    Visualise:
        See the resulting vector field in the viewport.
    Trail Count:
        Set the number of trails that should be generated for the visualization. This does not affect the exported resolution.
