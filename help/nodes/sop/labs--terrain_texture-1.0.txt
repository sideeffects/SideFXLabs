""" The Terrain Texture Output renders image data from a heightfield. """

The Terrain Texture Output renders image data from a heightfield as opposed to for example the Terrain Mesh Output which creates geometry. This tool can also export tiled images that match the naming and placement of the 

@parameters
    == Output ==
    Render:
        Render the output maps to disk and cut it up into tiles if tiling has been enabled.
    Output:
        The output location where the textures should be saved to. Use $(CHANNEL) to insert the channel name into the path, $(X) and $(Y) to insert the X and Y position.
    Divide into tiled maps:
        This allows for the to be exported maps to be divided into tiles.
    Render Resolution:
        This specifies the total resolution of the exported images.
    Tile Count:
        This specifies the number of tiles the exported images need to be divided in.
    Re-Export Tiles:
        Re-Export the texturemaps in tiled chunks without re-rendering the full image. This only works if the maps have been rendered once before.

    == Maps ==
    Normal:
        The channel name to be used for this map.
    Height:
        The channel name to be used for this map.
    Occlusion:
        The channel name to be used for this map.
    Cavity:
        The channel name to be used for this map.
    Curvature:
        The channel name to be used for this map.

    == Advanced ==
    Flip Y:
        Flip the Y component of the normalmap.
    Flip X:
        Flip the X component of the normalmap.
    Use MikkT:
        Use MikkT to generate normalmap.
    Remap Range:
        Controls the range that should be used to remap the height from to the 0-1 range.
    Raster Depth:
        Controls the precision used for the exported heightmap values.
