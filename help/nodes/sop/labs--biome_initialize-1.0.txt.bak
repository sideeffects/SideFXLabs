= Labs Biome Initialize (Beta) =

"""Processes input terrain types and creates biome regions, assigning necessary biome attributes and data used by the suite of biome tools."""


For terrain, Biome Initialize converts input terrain types into a Houdini Heightfield volume. For biome regions, the different options create flat, single-poly regions with primitive attributes and biome settings to deliminate the bounds of the expected biomes. Multiple input types are supported , but the two output types will always be a Houdini Heightfield volume for terrain and polygonal regions for biomes.
