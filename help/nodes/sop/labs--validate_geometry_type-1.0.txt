    == Geometry ==

    Geometry Type:
        #id: geotype#
	Geometry type to validate. 
        
    Comparison:
        #id: comparison#
	Comparison method for the chosen geometry type.
        

    Element Range:
        #id: range#
	A range of values to compare to the number of elements of the specified geometry type.
        
    Element Count:
        #id: expectednum#
	The expected number of elements of the specified geometry type.
        
    Equal To:
        #id: equalto#
        Enable to include the value of the element count in the comparison.
             Or Equal To     :
            
    Left Bracket:
        #id: lbracket#
	A bracket type of `[` means the value is included in the range, and a type of `(` means the value is excluded.
        
    Right Bracket:
        #id: rbracket#

    Warning Severity:
        #id: severity#
        Displays a feedback message if the expected type and element counts are not found.
        
        __Message:__ Displays an informative message. 
            
        __Warning:__ Displays a warning icon and a warning message.
            
        __Error:__ Displays an error message and prevent further nodes from cooking.
