""" Calculates and corrects texel density of an asset. """

This tool allows you to calculate the current texel density of an asset per primitive based on the asset and project resolution.
It also allows you to automatically scale all UVs to comply with the settings of the tool. Ensuring correct texeldensity of an asset makes sure your scene has a uniform level of detail in the materials, and helps optimizing a project by finding assets with textures that are too high resolution.

Texel Density is calculated as follows: Number of Pixels / Meter. So for example: 512px/100cm will produce a texel density of 5.12

@parameters
    == Asset Properties ==
    Asset Resolution:
        This is the resolution of the texture you plan on creating to this geometry.
    Size:
        The number of units in the measure used to calculate texel density.
    Unit:
        The unit of measure used to calculate the texeldensity. This is merely a scalar for the "Size" parameter so that you don't end up with huge numbers in the parameter.
    Visualize Density:
        Enabling this toggle will apply a checkerboard texture, and color the geometry based on the relative texeldensity to the target. Blue being less than ideal, Green being a match and Red being above.
    Scale UVs to Match Texel Density:
        This will automatically scale all your UVs to be the texel density requested.
    UV Layout:
        When enabled, the tool will do a layout of the UVs after scaling them. Disabling will scale all UVs in-place on the shell centroid.
    
    == ==
    Project Resolution:
        The resolution used as the baseline in the project. This makes sure the asset texel density is scaled relative to something.
    Reference Size:
        The baseline number of units in the measure used to calculate texel density in the project.
    Reference Unit:
        The baseline unit of measure used to calculate the texeldensity in the project. This is merely a scalar for the "Size" parameter so that you don't end up with huge numbers in the parameter.
