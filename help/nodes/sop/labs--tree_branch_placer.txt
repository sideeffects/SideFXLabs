""" Manually place tree branches """

This allows the user to manually place tree branches on a trunk created with the Tree Trunk Generator or on other branches created with the Tree Branch Generator or Tree Branch Placer.

This node is best used through it's viewstate by hitting enter while the cursor is over the viewport. Then:
LMB click to add branches and hold to move.
Shift-LMB drag to move placed branches.
Ctrl-LMB click to delete placed branches.
MMB click to select branch.
Scroll wheel to adjust branch length.
Shift-Scroll Wheel to rotate branch up and down.
Ctrl-Scroll Wheel to rotate around.
(Make sure to set the construction perpendicular to your tree - generally X or Z for proper branch movement)
