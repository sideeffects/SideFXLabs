"""Converts low-resolution blockout geometry into detailed buildings using a library of user defined modules."""

In game development it's a common workflow to 'block out' an environment with simple low resolution geometry, then later go an upres that geometry.

The building generator can accellerate that workflow by importing the low res buildings, slice buildings into floors, identify regions for corners and ledges, and replace those identified sections with high resolution 'modules'.

    Corners:
        Enable bottom ledge corners.
    Concave Corner Module:
        Bottom ledge corner module to use for 'outward' facing corners, the more common use case.
    Convex Corner Module:
        Bottm ledge corner module to use for 'inward' facing corners.
    == Secondary ==
    == Top Ledge ==
    Top:
        Enable ledges across top of floor.
    Height:
        Height in Houdini units for the bottom ledge.
    Module Pattern:
        Module name to use for bottom ledge.
    == Bottom Ledge ==
    Bottom:
        Enable bottom ledges per floor.
    == Sideslop ==
    Sideslop Module:
        Module to use in the gap between primary module and corner module.
    == Customization ==
    Floor Overrides:
        Number of floor overrides that are defined.
    === Settings ===
    Floor Index:
        Floor index to override, 0 being the ground floor.
    Floor Height:
        Height for this floor override.
