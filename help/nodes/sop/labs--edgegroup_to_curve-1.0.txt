""" Converts an Edge Group to a Poly Curve """

Edge Groups are a handy way of defining curves, but the process of extracting them from a mesh is not trivial, until now. 

This node will take an Edge Group, and convert it into a PolyCurve.

It will also provide an additional option to give the extracted curve some thickness. Useful for visualizing UV seams and other screenshotting purposes.

@parameters
    Group:
        Edge Group to Extract 
    Connect End Points:
        Connect curves that have overlapping ends into a single curve. 
    == Thickness ==
    Thicken:
        Toggles doing a Sweep on the generated curve in order to give it some thickness
    Divisions:
        Controls the resolution of the sweeping.
    Color:
        Vertex Color on the generated mesh
    Thickness:
        Controls the thickness of the sweeped result.
    == Attributes ==
    Transfer Attributes:
        Controls if surface attributes of the input mesh should be transferred to the points of the extracted curve.
