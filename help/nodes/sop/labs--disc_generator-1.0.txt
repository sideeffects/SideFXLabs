""" Create a polygon disc with uvs"""

The disc generator wraps up some common functionality for generating discs for realtime vfx. You can quickly set the inner and outer radius, and modify the profile to shape the disc for multiple use cases. UVs are automatically laid out and adjusted with override controls.

@parameters

    Inner Radius:
        #id: innerradius
	Defines the radius of the inner circle for the disc.

    Outer Radius:
        #id: outerradius
	Defines the radius of the outer circle for the disc.

    Sides:
        #id: sides
	Determines the number of sides the disc will have.

    Segments:
        #id: segments
	Determines the number of polygon segments from the inner edge to the outer edge of the disc.

    Arc Start:
        #id: arcstart
	Determines the starting point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Arc End:
        #id: arcend
	Determines the ending point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Orientation:
        #id: orientation
	Orientation of the shape.

    Translate:
        #id: translate
	Location of the center of the shape.

    Inner Height:
        #id: innerheight
	Determines the height of the inner circle. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Outer Height:
        #id: outerheight
	Determines the height of the outer circle. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Enable Ramp:
        #id: enableramp
	Uses a multiplier and a ramp to change the height profile of the disc.

    Ramp Multiplier:
        #id: rampmultiplier
	Multiplies the effect of the curve ramp that is being used.

    Curve Ramp:
        #id: curveramp
	Applies the ramp to modify the height profile of the disc.

    Add UVs:
        #id: adduvs
	Generates UVs for the fill of the disc.
