""" Place stickers in your network editor """

The sticker placer is a very simple tool that uses the built-in background image placer, but wraps a nice visual interface around it. The default set of stickers feature some of the known icons found throughout Houdini, but also allows for custom stickers you want yourself.

NOTE:
    To add custom stickers, set the $STICKER_PATH variable to a directory containing subfolders with stickers in them.
    Example: $STICKER_PATH = "C:/MyPath/". Any folders found inside that directory specified will get picked up. For example a folder called "Unicorns". Images directly found in the directory specified will NOT get picked up.
    Multiple directories can also be specified by separating paths by a semicolon. Example: STICKER_PATH = "$MYSTICKERS/;C:/Mypath2/".

TIP:
    Pressing Control + i enables or disables the editing of background images placed in the network editor. It also al	lows you to connect images to nodes, so that the images move when the node does.

WARNING:
    Stickers are currently NOT saved into the HIP file, so make sure any custom paths you add to the STICKER_PATH variable are accessible on other machines you load the hip files in.
