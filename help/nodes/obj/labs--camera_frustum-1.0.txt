""" This OBJ sets up a camera frustum and padded frustum based on the input parent camera. """

This OBJ sets up a camera frustum and padded frustum based on the input parent camera.
It uses the parent camera's parameter values to define it's near/far planes.
You can define a padded frustum either in the parameter panel or in the viewport thanks to the camera furstum state.
This is useful for selections based on the camera view.

@parameters

    == Padding Options ==

    Point Group:
        #id: ptgroup
        The points to restrict the sort to. Only these points will be re-arranged by the point sorting choices.

    Point Sort:
        How to sort the elements.

        Circular (Around Vector):
            Orders the elements counterclockwise by their position around a certain line in 3D space.
            You can define that line with the Vector parameter.

    Vector:
        #id: pointdir
        When the sort method is "Along Vector" or "Circular (Around Vector)", the vector to use for sorting. This vector is signed, so a value of `0, 1, 0` is the equivalent of sorting By Y, while `0, -1, 0` is the reverse.

    == Display Options ==

    Primitive Group:
        #id: primgroup
        The primitives to restrict the sort to.  Only these primitives will be re-arranged by the primitive sorting operation.
