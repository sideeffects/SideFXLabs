""" Imports geometry attributes as imageplanes using a uv attribute  """

This node will import geometry attributes into cops as imageplanes using a uv lookup. You can specify which geometry to import from, and what attribute should be used as uvs.
Note that you can import vector attributes into RGB (`C`) channel, and float into A (`A`). Importing a float attribute into RGB will give you the first component in all RGB channels.

@parameters
    Resolution:
        Controls the resolution of the imageplanes to be generated.
    Geometry:
        This should point to the SOP node containing geometry, uvs and the attributes you want to import.
    UV attribute:
        The attribute that should be used to do a lookup with to import attributes with.
    == RGB ==
    Attribute:
        The attribute which should be imported into this imageplane.
    == A ==
    Attribute:
        The attribute which should be imported into this imageplane.
