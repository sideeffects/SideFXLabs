""" Convert volume or point velocities to texture space motion vectors for a sequence. """

The Motion Vector ROP can be used to generate a texture for time warping texture sheets in your game engine. It requires a vel field for volumes or the point attribute v to create the texture space vectors. Attempting to create motion vectors for low density volumes can sometimes create inaccurate results. Using an external package to generate optical flow maps is recommended in that case.

@parameters
    Start/End:
        Start and End frame of the render sequence.
    Export Node:
        Node to export. Make sure you select the object level node.
    Camera:
        Render Camera.
    Output Picture:
        Path to render sequence.
    Motion Vector Map:
        Path to motion vector image.
    Images per Line:
        Number of images, side-by-side, on the horizontal axis.
    Atlas Resolution:
        Final resolution of the motion vector image. This is not the same as the resolution for each frame in the render sequence.
    No. Of Frames:
        Total number of frames from start to finish
    Atlas Layout:
        How the images are laid out in the texture sheet.
    Resolution per Frame:
        The resolution for each frame based on the atlas resolution and images per line.
    Raw Multiplier:
        The exported image has normalized values. Sometimes the movement per pixel is greater than 1. This multiplier captures that difference. Copy and paste this value into the raw multiplier input of the material function in UE4.
    Material Function Code:
        Copy and paste this code into a material function in UE4.
