""" This tool allows for fast export of an RBD Sim to bone based FBX """

The RBD to FBX ROP takes in an RBD simulation containing packed primitives and uses its attribute to construct a flat hierarchy and exports it as an FBX.

@parameters
    Render:
        Hitting this button will start the conversion process and write the FBX to disk.
    == Settings ==
    Node To Export:
        This should be set to the sop containing the RBD simulation you want to export. For example your dopimport sop.
    Export Path:
        This is the path specifying where your FBX will be saved to.
    Start/End/Inc:
        Allows you to set your desired export frame range.
    Group:
        With this parameter you can specify to only export packed primitives from a certain group.
    == Advanced ==
    Override Name:
        You can give the generated pieces inside the FBX a custom name. Useful if you have a certain naming convention to adhere to.
    Name Override:
        Allows you to set the name override of the generated pieces.
    Convert Axis System:
        Toggling this on will make the FBX get exported in a different coordinate system specified by the "Axis System" parameter.
    Axis System:
        Controls the coordinate system that will be used to export the FBX.
    Convert Units:
        Turning this on will convert the scene units used to the native centimeters used by FBX.
    Export in ASCII Format:
        Enabling this will use the ASCII format to export the FBX. This makes it human readable instead of binary, but does increase the exported file size.
